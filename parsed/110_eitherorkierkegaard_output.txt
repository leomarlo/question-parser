Many believe they, too, are this when after doing one thing or another they unite or mediate these opposites.
Certainly you are not the unhappiest one, but do you not think, dear ~U!-ltaQ(l.Vâ‚¬XQW!-lâ‚¬VOL, that we can award her an honorable accessit [second place]?
Here again there will be occasion to see in what sense I can call the previous stages by that name when I call Don Giovanni the third stage.
Psychologically, it is very interesting to observe a child when he sees an adult suffer.
Isolation always consists in asserting oneself as number; when one wants to assert oneself as one, this is isolation; all the friends of associations will surely agree with me on that, without therefore being able or willing to see that it is altogether the same isolation when a hundred assert themselves simply and solely as a hundred.
Therefore, when Antigone, in defiance of the king's injunction, decides to bury her brother, we see in this not so much a free act as a fateful necessity, which visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children.
Think of our school days; we were at an age when there was no esthetic consideration in the choosing of our teachers, and therefore they were often very boring--how resourceful we were then! What fun we had catching a fly, keeping it prisoner under a nutshell, and watching it run around with it! What delight in cutting a hole in the desk, confining a fly in it, and peeking at it through a piece of paper! How entertaining it can be to listen to the monotonous dripping from the roof! What a meticulous observer one becomes, detecting every little sound or movement.
The difficulties that always arise when music is made the object of esthetic consideration will of course not be absent here either.
On the other hand, what was it that delayed the fall of Rome?
Then I will steal into his soul when he wants to love another-not in order to kill this love; that would be no punishment, for  know that he loves her just as little as he loved me.
Eternal Love, let your mercy hold me, do not thrust me away; give him back to me, incline his heart to me again; have mercy on me, God of mercy, that I pray this way again! "Can I curse him, then?
To forget--this is the desire of all people, and when they encounter something unpleasant, they always say: If only I could forget! But to forget is an art that must be practiced in advance.
No, surely he was no deceiver, and how could that voice deceive?
When one reads a name in an epitaph, one is easily tempted to wonder how he passed his life on earth; one might wish to climb down into the grave for a conversation with him.
Does she dare to confide it to any human being, even to the man she loves?
When Cherubino, light as a bird, boldly leaps through the window, it affects Susanna so powerfully that she nearly faints, and when she has recovered she cries out, "See how he runs-oh, won't he be a success with the girlS!" This is entirely appropriate for Susanna to say, and the reason for her fainting is not simply the performance of the bold leap but rather that he has already been a success with her.
Or is it not, then, a reason to love methat I need you, that my soul languishes when you are not with me?
What is the meaning of friendship?
Shall I become a murderer, then?
Let us take an idea, an expression, from your poetic world, or from the real world of first love: "the lovers look at one another." You know very well how to underscore this word "look" and to put into it an infinite reality, an eternity.
Have I lost my mind; out oflove for Mozart's music, have my ears ceased to hear?
This no doubt is due to the sure esthetic eye with which Heiberg always comprehends his task, the taste with which he knows how to discriminate, but in the present instance it is still not impossible that Prof.
What shall I do?
"Do you want youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful girl, or anyone of the other glorious things we have in the treasure chest?
When was it that the hetairias became common in Greece except at the time when the state was in the process of disintegration?
As for Elvira, the factual evidence that Don Giovanni was a deceiver seems so obvious that it is hard to see how reflection can take hold of it.
And when I have brought her to the point where I want her, then she is mine." But perhaps I have already misused my position as editor to burden the readers with my observations.
Once again I was absorbed in contemplation of the lust oflife and the serene peace of the cloister, when high up on the mountain I saw a female figure.
For the sake of completeness I shall transcribe the whole of it:
 
How much must come together in the world That love's enchantment may be brought to pass! First the two hearts which know each other well, Then charm which doth accompany them both, The moon then casting its bewitching beams Through the beech forests in the early spring, Then that these two can meet there all alone Then the first kiss-and then .
But what is this thing you are accustomed to think of as not merely annihilated but profaned by the "custom" which is inseparable from conjugal love?
What is going to happen?
On the other hand, when an adult sees a young person, a child, suffer, the pain is greater, the sorrow less.
Gradually that desk assumed a history for me; to see it became a necessity to me, and when on a rare occasion it was necessary to make a detour for its sake, I did not hesitate.
Already in the ethical and religious factors it has duty in it, and when this appears before it, it is not as a Stranger, a shameless intruder, who nevertheless has such authority that one dare not by virtue of the mysteriousness of love show him the door.
What one has loved with youthful infatuation, what one has admired with youthful enthusiasm, that with which one has kept secret, enigmatic company in the inwardness of the soul, that which one has hidden in the heartone always approaches this with a certain shyness, with mixed feelings, when one knows that the purpose is to understand it.
On closer scrutiny, one perhaps will find it entirely appropriate and here see an example of how literally it must be understood that Don Giovanni is everywhere present in the opera, for this can hardly be more strongly expressed than by pointing out that even when he is
 
gone he is present.
When Epaminondas was wounded in the battle at Mantinea, he let the arrow remain in the wound until he heard that the battle was won, for he knew that it was his death when it was pulled out.
Should we rejoice over that, dear ~U!AJtaQavEX{)W!EVOL, rejoice that its existence mocks our doctrine of the downfall of everything, or should we not lament instead that it survives and rejoice that in any case it has only one year left to continue, for ifit has not vanished within that time, was it not our decision to dissolve it ourselves?
And what consolation is there in scorning him?
When desire has not awakened, that which is desired fascinates and captivates-indeed, almost causes anxiety.
He meets her at Oedipus's grave, where she has gone to pour out her heart, where she abandons herself to her longing for her father, even if this longing is itself mixed with pain because she does not know how she is going to meet him again, whether or not he knew of his guilt.
Just as ghosts in the underworld, when a living being fell into their hands, sucked his blood and lived as long as this blood warmed and nourished them, so Faust seeks an immediate life whereby he will be rejuvenated and strengthened.
As long as he was with her, she did not discover the doubt; now when he is gone, everything is changed for her, and she sees doubt in everything, a doubt she cannot control since she always includes in her thinking the fact that Faust himself was unable to master it.
What is love?
But now she is indebted to him for the content of faith, and yet when he has forsaken her she perceives that he himself has not believed in it.
You will, perhaps, make answer that this remedy is no remedy; but to that I will remark that it depends upon how one looks at the matter.
She is sure prey for a Don Giovanni; he will know how to coax out the passion-wild, ungovernable, insatiable, to be satisfied only in his love.
Even when the erotic is not entirely neutralized, it is nevertheless disheartened by a -cool common-sense consideration that one must be prudent, not be too quick in sorting and rejecting, that life after all never presents the ideal, that it is quite a respectable match, etc.
They sense that it is inappropriate to go on declaring that she is going to die when she continues to live; in addition, they do not feel able to do it with the same pathos-filled energy as at the beginning, and yet this was a prerequisite if there was to be any solace for her.
And yet she does not dare to abandon herself to sorrow, does not dare to
 
 
mourn; she feels how much depends upon her; she fears that a clue would be given if anyone saw her suffering, and so here, too, she finds not sorrow but pain.
When music is used, one is on the wrong road altogether and makes the patient even more insane, even ifhe seems not to be so anymore.
Iflove cannot last, what, then, can last?
To run into such difficulties at the very moment when the coachman's enticing tones were still ringing in my ears! The blood rushed to my head; I was furious.
When I consider its various epochs, my life is like the word Schnur inthe dictionary, which first of all means a string, and second a daughter-in-law.
If one finds this entirely appropriate, the impression is shaken for a moment when we learn that Don Juan is also the fellow who has seduced Elvira, murdered the Commander, etc., something one finds extremely unreasonable and that in turn must be explained as a lie in order to bring about harmony.
He does not love people at all; he loves only ideas, thoughts, his powerful influence at court, his intellectual power-I cannot imagine how he can love all these things.

And has not one generation after another endured the troubles and complications of four acts if only there was some likelihood of a happy marriage in the fifth?
But how pitiful it is that this should be the only comfort that is left to the poetry of our age, the comfort of despairing; for it is evidently despair which makes such an alliance acceptable.
Can that voice deceive?
Am I not living off him?
Love drives out fear; yet when love is for a moment fearful for itself., fearful of its own salvation, duty is the nutriment of all others love stands in need of; for it says, "Fear not, you shall conquer," speaking not futuristically, for that only suggests hope, but imperatively, and in this lies an assurance which nothing can shake.
Ordinarily when we use the word "plurality," we mean a unity that is the final result; in music such is not the case.
Will you forsake me for this?
She has lost all-heaven when she chose the world, the world when she lost Giovanni.
Was I not his?
For this reason, once when there was a great catch of salmon, the police in Hamburg ordered each master of a household to give his servants salmon not more than once a week.
When she chose the convent, her proud soul perhaps found rich satisfaction in it, because, say what you will, no girl makes as brilliant a match as she who espouses heaven; but now, on the other hand, now she will have to return penitently, in repentance and contrition.
Or should I perhaps be satisfied that he once loved me?
But how does the idea become concrete?
For example, when it is said of Jehovah that he is ajealous God, that he visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations,  or when we hear those terrible curses in the Old Testament, one could easily be tempted to want to seek tragic material here.
Neither do they contain any hint as to how it went with B, whether he was able to hold fast to his point of view or not.
If the various media are ordered according to a specific process of development, language and music must be placed closest to each other, and that is also why it has been said that music is a language, which is more than a clever observation.
For example, when a brook ripples and keeps on rippling, there seems to be a qualification of time involved therein.
This is how she encounters Don Giovanni.
I should perhaps be a prudent girl and not throw him away in proud contempt now when I know that he is a deceiver; I should perhaps be a good housewife who, with economic sense, knows how to stretch as far as possible the little that she has.
There is also something else, however, in married life which you characterize by the word "custom": "its monotony," you say, "the total lack of events, its everlasting vacuity, which is death and worse than death." You know that there are neurasthenics who may be disturbed by the slightest noise, who are unable to think when someone is walking softly across the floor.
N ow, if it is the immediate, qualified by spirit, that receives its proper expression in the musical, the question may be raised again more pointedly: What kind of immediacy is it that is essentially the theme of music?
Even when he was alive, Antigone knew this secret but did not have the courage to confide in her father.
But one is absent when one is in either past or future time.
Just as the Middle Ages had tales of sorcerers who knew how to prepare a rejuvenating potion and used the heart of an innocent child for it, so this is the strengthening his emaciated soul needs, the only thing that can satisfy him for a moment.
How dreadful boredom is-how dreadfully boring; I know no stronger expression, no truer one, for like is recognized only by like.
A few days ago, I heard a soldier speaking with another soldier about a third one who had deceived a girl; he did not describe it in detail, and yet his expression was excellent: "He knew how to do it with lies and all that." Such a seducer is of a kind entirely different from Don Giovanni, differs from him essentially, which can also be seen in this, that he and his activities are extremely unmusical and
 
esthetically fall within the category of the interesting.
If you cannot reach the point of seeing the aesthetical, the ethical, and the religious as three great allies, if you do not know how to conserve the unity of the diverse appearances which everything assumes in these diverse spheres, then life is devoid of meaning, then one must grant that you are justified in maintaining your pet theory that one can say of everything, "Do it or don't do it-you will regret both." .
At whose hand does she fall, then?
But only let our age go on consuming-and the more it manages to consume of the substantial value contained in romantic love with all the more consternation will it some day, when this annihilation no longer gives pleasure, awaken to the consciousness of what it has lost and despairingly feel its misfortune.
Have they not already received a higher initiation?
Shame on you, wretched, cowardly heart; hold yourself in contempt; learn to be great, learn it from him; he has loved me better than I have understood how to love myself.
My pace slackened and my thoughts also, and what indeed is there to hurry after when one is so near the cloister?
Or did he perhaps make a mistake; was it perhaps an illusion that he loved me, an illusion that disappeared like a dream-is this befitting in a man?
So then the moment remains the principal thing, and how often one has I heard these shameless words addressed by such a lover to a poor girl who could love only once: "I do not demand so much, I am content with less; far be it from me to require that you shall continue to love me to all eternity, if only you love me at the instant when I wish it." Such lovers know very well that the sensuous is transient, they know also what is the most beautiful instant and therewith they are content.
Perhaps there is nothing striking about the exterior, but when I look through it, only then do I discover the interior picture, which is what I want to show, an interior picture that is too delicate to be externally perceptible, since it is woven from the soul's faintest moods.

You two unfortunate artists, do you know that those strains hide in themselves the glories of the whole world?
Indeed, if there were a human being who could not die, if what the legend tells of the Wandering Jew is true, why should we have scruples about pronouncing him the unhappiest one?
In romantic love, on the other hand, you think this is all right, for as soon as the instant arrives when duty is mentioned, love is over, and the arrival of duty is the signal for you, with a very courtly bow, to say farewell.
He is not suffi"ciently reflective to have an idea of sin and guilt; when he sees an adult suffer, it does not cross his mind to think about that, and yet if the reason for the suffering is hidden from him, there is a dark presentiment of the reason in the child's sorrow.
When an individual has perfected himself in the art of forgetting and the art of recollecting in this way, he is then able to play shuttlecock with all existence .
And who could keep from laughing?
Should I fear this anxiety, then; does it not remind me of him; is it not the announcement of his coming?
He tilted his big head to one side a bit, fastened his enormous eyes on her with a certain roguishness and then said quite phlegmatically, "Not this Maren; it was another Maren." What do we adults do?
Then when I walk past people, happy-go-lucky as a god, and they envy me because of my good fortune, I laugh, for I despise people, and I take my rcvenge.
I watched how the pearls of perspiration collected on his forehead, then united in a rivulet, slid down his nose, and ended in a quivering globule that remained suspended at the end of his nose.

If so, it would just have to stop flowing! Can the arrow, however swiftly it flies, forget the bowstring?
When I was very young, I forgot in the Trophonean cave how to laugh; when I became an adult, when I opened my eyes and saw actuality, then I started to laugh and have never stopped laughing since that time.
But what kind of power is it, then, by which Don Giovanni seduces?
But this lyrical rapture over Mozart's music is not enough, and however well it suits the man, and however beautifully he knows how to express himself, Mozart's Don Giovanni is not acknowledged in its absolute validity by this interpretation.
I examine myself; when I am tired of that, I smoke a cigar for diversion and think: God knows what our Lord actually intended with me or what he wants to make of me.
Compared with a word from you, what power does the tenderness of the whole world have?
So it is also, but in complete and deep harmony, with the sorrow of the Greeks, and that is why it is simultaneously so gentle and so deep.
By reason of its disposition to reflection the love here in question has with a terrible firmness and induration of mind made up a new definition of what unhappy love is, namely, to be loved when one no longer loves-the opposite of loving without requital.
Mozart's music certainly has been tempting, for where is the young man who has not had a moment in his life when he would have given half his kingdom to be a Don Juan, or perhaps all of it, when he would have given half his lifetime for one year of being Don Juan, or perhaps his whole life?
"Who knows so surely that I may not change?
When the grateful nation acclaims Oedipus with praise and thanksgiving, she feels her own significance, and her secret sinks deeper and deeper into her soul, ever more inaccessible to any living being.
When they are alone their thoughts disappear in the indefinite; on the other hand, when there is noise and hubbub around them, this compels them to pit their will against it.
-I did not know it, but he taught it to me-and why am I no longer beautiful?
What is a poet?
There would also be no lack of opportunity to illuminate the erotic from a new side by observing how the attempt to put a more profound ethical view into it, in such a way that it tries its hand at all sorts of rather important dialectical engagements, is a daring venture that has ventured far beyond the boundaries of music, so that it was impossible even for a Mozart to invest it with any deeper interest.
We wish her an honorable marriage and promise to dance on her wedding day, when fortunately the changed name will bring us to forget that it was the Marie Beaumarchais of whom we have spoken.
Therefore, when we later hear about Don Giovanni: Even coquettes as old as sixty He gladly records in his tally,  we have the perfect analogy to this, except that the intensity and firmness of the desire are far more developed.
His sick soul needs what could be called the first greening of a young heart, and to what else could I compare the early youth of an innocent feminine soul?
Or was it fickleness; is it befitting for a man to be fickle?
Can I forget him?
First of all you must concede to me that so long as there is no alteration in first love (and this, we have agreed, is contained in conjugal love) there can be no question of the strict necessity of duty?
So if I, trying to do my part to help the reader gain a picture of Don Giovanni, were to say: See, there he stands! See how his eyes flame; he smiles triumphantly, so sure is he of his conquest.
When once you have got the desperate idea that duty is the enemy of love, your defeat is certain, and you have done just as much to disparage love and deprive it of its majesty as you have done to show despite of duty, and yet it was only the latter you meant to do.
Therefore, when selecting a nursemaid, one always considers essentially not only that she is sober, trustworthy, and good-natured but also takes into esthetic consideration whether she knows how to entertain children.
The destroyed possibility appears transfigured in a higher possibility, whereas the temptation to conjure up a new possibility such as this is not as great when it is an actuality that has been shattered, because the actuality is higher than the possibility.
Is this a reward of the gods, to give unhappy me, who sits like a beggar at the door of the temple, ears that themselves perform what they hear?
When at times she wants to tear herself away from all this, wants to reduce it to nothing, this is again only a mood, a momentary passion, and reflection continually goes on being the victor.
This in turn occurs because it comes into existence in another sense, and that is why I promptly said that boldly ventured is only half won.
Juan, then his expression is such a travesty that it is impossible to keep from laughing-for example, when Sganarelle tells Gusman that Don Juan, in order to obtain the one he wants, "would gladly marry her dog or cat-yes, even worse, marry you, too.
For, of course, if duty has not already subsisted as a germ in first love, it is absolutely disturbing when it makes its appearance.
And does not this longing acquire a double significance when with it there is associated the conception of another being which also has its home in these regions?
The formula is as follows: when two quantities are equal in size to one and the same third quantity, they are all of equal size.
To be able to forget always depends upon how one experiences actuality.
When insanity has a mental basis, it is always due to a hardening at some point in the consciousness.
And I should be angry with him?
To develop in greater detail the transition in this aria, how in the beginning it is quiet and less stirring but becomes more and more intense as Don Giovanni's life resonates in it more and more, how Leporello is more and more swept away by it, wafted away and rocked by these erotic breezes, how it is variously nuanced accordingly as the diversity of femininity that lies within Don Giovanni's range becomes audible in it-this is not the place for that.
We shall now proceed and see how the unhappy individuality may be defined more precisely.
In fact, it is really lucky that you did buy it, for every time you look at it you will be reminded of how prodigal you were; with this desk commences a new period in your life.
How many he has seduced is of no importance here; what occupies us is the artistry, the meticulousness, the profound cunning with which he seduces.
How many are there who-inspired by what is talked about so much in our age, that man is created in God's image-have the authentic voice of command?
Human dignity is still acknowledged even in nature, for when we want to keep birds away from the trees we set up something that is supposed to resemble a human being, and even the remote resemblance a scarecrow has to a human being is sufficient to inspire respect.
When one reflects on Greek love, it is according to its concept essentially faithful simply because it is psychical; and it is something accidental in the particular individual that he loves many; and with regard to the many he loves, it is again accidental every time he loves a new one; when he loves one, he is not thinking of the next one.
It is another matter when the objective sorrow or the occasion of the sorrow in the individual himself fosters the reflection that makes the sorrow into a reflective sorrow.
If! were to imagine a person who had lived without grasping the joy of life or the enjoyment of it and who now at the point of death had his eyes opened to it, if I were to imagine that he did not die, which would be the best that could happen, but revived without therefore living his life over again, this person surely could be considered when the question arises about who is the unhappiest one.
The immediate Don Juan must seduce,; the reflective Don Juan needs to seduce only one, and how he does it is what occupies us.
You are within yourself only when there is opposition, but therefore you are never within yourself.
What will the future bring?
When the immediate, qualified by spirit, is qualified in such a way that it falls within the realm of spirit, it can certainly find its expression in the musical, but this immediacy still cannot be music's absolute theme, for when it is qualified in such a way that it will fall within the realm of spirit, this suggests that music is in alien territory; it forms a prelude that is continually being annulled.
I choose for this the overture, which certainly best gives the dominant tone of the opera in a compact concentration; I choose next the most epic and the most lyrical part in the piece in order to
 
show how even in the outer limits the perfection of the opera is preserved, the musical-dramatic is sustained, how it is Don Giovanni who musically carries the opera.
He is exhausted, and yet how full of energy; his eyes do not seem to have shed, but to have drunk, many tears, and yet they flame with a fire that could consume the whole world, but not a splinter of sorrow in his own breast; he is bowed down, and yet his youth portends a long life; his lips smile at the world, which does not understand him.
It is not at all my intention to deny what in fact has been acknowledged many times, that music may have its importance as an accompaniment when entering a foreign domain, namely, the domain of language.
Can the brook, however long it keeps on running, forget the spring, forget its source, sever itself from it?
In the same way, in entirely the same way, Zerlina is dangerous to him when she has been seduced.
It has already been pointed out that music as a medium does not rank as high as language, and that is why I said that music, understood in a certain way, is a language.
Is there not the same law for a man's love as for a woman's?
Which medium is the most abstract?
And what, after all, is human life, the human race, when these two things are taken away?

When Aristotle distinguishes between fear and compassion, one presumably could rather think of the fear as the mood accompanying the particular and of the compassion as the mood that is the definitive impression.
In order to be able to recollect in this way, one must be very much aware of how one lives, especially of how one enjoys.
We have now seen how romantic love was built upon an illusion, that the eternity it claims was built upon the temporal, and that although the knight of romantic love was sincerely convinced of its absolute durability, there nevertheless was no certainty of this, inasmuch as its trials and temptations have hitherto been in a medium which was entirely external.
For example, we say: I cannot really explain why I do this or that in such a way-I play it by ear.
Do these passions belong there-in the world?
"What assurance has a man that he will not change?
It is, therefore, surely a misunderstanding of the tragic when our age endeavors to have everything fateful transubstantiate itself into individuality and subjectivity.

Therefore, when I see a fly settle on the nose of one of those men of business in a decisive moment, or ifhe is splashed by a carriage that passes him in even greater haste, or Knippelsbr  tilts up, or a roof tile falls and kills him,  I laugh from the bottom of my heart.
What is being done in our day?
When Don Juan is comprehended in this way, there is meaning and deep significance in everything.
For example, in the second act, at the crucial moment when Ottavio finally has gathered courage in his heart and taken the rapier out of its sheath to murder Don Giovanni, she hurls herself between them and then discovers that it is not Don Giovanni but Leporello--a differentiation that Mozart has so powerfully expressed with a kind of plaintive bleat.
So it is when the subject matter is made the principle of division.
As I stood there lost in these thoughts, a passerby addressed me and said as he pointed up to the clouds, "Do you see that funnel-shaped cloud?
How is a friend defined?
When this happens, there frequently follow sympathetic outpourings on how beautifully and richly and profusely Mozart has expressed all this.
Therefore, ifI were to raise the question of Don Giovanni's appearance, is he handsome, young or old, approximately how old, then it would only be a concession from my side and what can be said about it can expect to find a place here in the same way a tolerated sect finds a place in the state church.
But what can evoke this tremor, what provocation?
Can the clay pot be presumptuous toward the potter?
The idea of the seducer is suggested in the piece on the immediate erotic as well as in "Silhouettes"-namely, that the counterpart to Don Giovanni must be a reflective seducer in the category of the interesting, where the issue therefore is not how many he seduces but how.
I feel as a chessman must feel when the opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.
And does not our age have a striking likeness to that age, which not even Aristophanes could make more ludicrous than it actually was?
Now, if boredom, as discussed above, is the root of all evil, what then is more natural than to seek to conquer it?
All the plans I project fly straight back at me; when I want to spit, I spit in my own face.
Should I then communicate my sorrow to the world, make one more contribution to prove how pitiable and wretched everything is, perhaps discover a new, hitherto undetected stain [Plet] in human life?
Once this feeling is present, it can never turn out that one has made a mistake such as Gert Westphaler made when he drank dus with the executioner.

Why not settle it all at once, why not stay out there and go along down into the grave and draw lots to see to whom will befall the misfortune of being the last of the living who throws the last three spadefuls of earth on the last of the dead?
What, do you really think That there are gods?
Then why the grave was empty could be explained-namely, to indicate that the unhappiest one was the person who could not die, who could not slip down into a grave.
Are they not just like that woman who, in a flurry because the house was on fire, rescued the fire tongs?
The person who is grieving finds relief, and the sympathetic knight of grief rejoices over having found what he sought, for we seek not the present but the past, not joy, for it is always present, but sorrow, for its nature is to pass by, and in the present moment we see it just as we see a person when we catch sight of him for just a moment and then he turns down another street and disappears.

What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding; what if laughter really were weeping! There are particular occasions when one may be most painfully moved to see a person standing utterly alone in the world.
Here I wish only to draw attention to the remarkable circumstance that by a movement in the opposite direction I once again encounter music, namely, when I descend from prose permeated by the concept until I end up with interjections, which in turn are musical, just as a child's first babbling is musical.
Am I nothing at all, then, not even able to weep except through him! "Where shall I find peace and rest?
Only when reflection enters in does the kingdom manifest itself as the kingdom of sin, but then Don Juan has been slain, then the music stops, then one sees only the desperate defiance that powerlessly resists but can find no firm ground, not even in sounds.
There is also something upon which You will agree with me entirely, for how often and how surely have your mockery and your irony hit the mark when you were denouncing what you call "fortuitous love affairs" and the "bad infinity" of love-when one is looking with his sweetheart out of the window, and that instant a young girl turns the corner into another street, and it occurs to him, "It is with her I am really in love," but when he would follow her trace he is again unsettled, etc.
The point is that I do not
 
stop now, but I stopped when I began.
Everything must be thought of as focused on this one main point of interest that makes up the content of Antigone's life, and when the whole thing is designed in this way, then the question is: How is the dramatic interest to be produced?
I have tried to suggest this by the little picture I outlined above; it was not that I thought she wa?
So if art will not limit itself to the naIvete (examples are found in old books) in which a figure is portrayed that can represent almost anything, but one discovers on its breast a plaque, a heart or something similar, on which one may read everything, especially when the figure's posture draws a person's attention to it, even points to it, an effect that could just as well be achieved by writing above it "Please note!"-if art will not do this, it will be obliged to reject pictures of that kind and leave reflective grief to poetic or psychological treatment.
When a person standing on a high point gazes out over a flat region and sees several roads running parallel to one another, he will, ifhe lacks intuition, see only the roads, and the fields between them will seem to disappear, or he will see only the fields, and the roads will disappear; however, he who has an intuitive eye will see them together, will see the whole section as striped.
In such a case it is a motive foreign to the marriage which decides the matter-as, e.g. when a young girl, out of love for her family, marries a man who is in a position to rescue it.
Was he not mine?
They fell in love with a girl, moved heaven and earth to possess her; when they succeeded, they perhaps grew weary of
 
her and sought a new love.
But it is not said thereby that it is the kingdom of sin, for it must be contained in the moment when it appears in esthetic indifference.
Her love gives her significance for him, and yet she becomes practically a child; he condescends to her childlikeness and has his joy in seeing how she appropriates everything.
You also will perceive the correctness of this when you reflect that if one were to marry merely in the hope of a silver wedding, and then hoped and hoped again for twenty-five years, one would be in no state to celebrate the silver wedding when the twenty-fifth year came around, for indeed one would have nothing to recollect, since with all this hoping everything would have fallen apart.
When I see myself cursed, abhorred, hated for my coldness and heartlessness, thcn I laugh, then my rage is satisfied.
It does not occur to Antigone to wish anyone to come to know her pain, but instead she feels the pain in relation to her father, feels the justice implicit in sorrowing, which is just as warranted esthetically as is suffering punishment when one has done wrong.
What would His Reverence Jesper Morten have done, I wonder, in my place?
When two people fall in love with each other and sense that they are destined for each other, it is a question of having the courage to break it off, for by continuing there is only everything to lose, nothing to gain.
So because you do not believe in it, you dare not enter into an alliance which, when you no longer are volens may compel you nolens to remain in it.
How sterile my soul and my mind are, and yet constantly tormented by empty voluptuous and excruciating labor pains! Will the tongue ligament of my spirit never be loosened; will I always jabber?
Perhaps the time is coming when Europe will import the customs of foreign lands.
On the other hand, you think that when duty makes its appearance it is all over with love, and you think also that duty, early or late, must make its appearance, not merely in conjugal love but also in romantic love; and the truth is that you are afraid of conjugal love because it has in it duty to such a degree that when it makes its appearance you cannot run away from it.
It would not have been enough if he had encouraged them by saying, "It can be done, love can be preserved"; but when he says, "It shall be preserved," there is in that an authority which answers to the heartfelt desire of love.
It never occurs to him how beautiful it is that true greatness is common to all, that a farmhand goes to Tribler's widow  or to a ballad-monger on Halmtorv  and reads it half aloud to himself at the same time Goethe is writing a Faust.
When one throws a pebble in such a way that it skims the surface of the water, it can for a time skip over the water in light hops, but it sinks down to the bottom
 
 
as soon as it stops skipping; in the same way he dances over the abyss, jubilating during his brief span.
Is it to hide her shame and disgrace, or to catch up with Don Giovanni?
If, then, my thesis is true, a person needs only to ponder how corrupting boredom is for people, tempering his reflections more or less according to his desire to diminish or increase his impetus, and if he wants to press the speed of the motion to the highest point, almost with danger to the locomotive, he needs only to say to himself: Boredom is the root of all evil.
And yet what a difference! Tamino's flute, which nevertheless is the one the play is named after, miscarries completely, and why?
For what is it that nourishes my hatred except my love for him?
What is youth?
When I rode slowly through the forest, it seemed as if! were flying.
Not until spirit is posited is language installed in its rights, but when spirit is posited, everything that
 
The Immediate Erotic Stages
 
is not spirit is excluded.
Just as someone who has been standing or sitting for a long time in a forced position pleasurably stretches his body, just as a branch that has long been bent by force and then, when the bond is broken, joyfully takes its natural position again, so also does she find refreshment.
My heart has never been hardened toward anyone, but I have always made it appear, especially when I was touched most deeply, as if my heart were closed and alien to every feeling.
Why is it my friend?
Stat-at-ues is it?
When B supposes that out of a hundred people who go astray in the world ninety-nine are saved by women and one by divine grace,  it is easy to see that he is not very good in mathematics, inasmuch as he gives no place to those who are actually lost.
For that purpose, we arise in the middle of the night like robbers; this is why we risk everything, for no passion is as wild as the passion of sympathy.
This is why he cannot be given lines, but the music remains the only adequate expression, and thus it is noteworthy that Figaro and Don Giovanni, in their original form from the hand of Mozart, belong to opera seria [serious opera].
Sensuous immediacy has its absolute medium in music, and this also explains why music in the ancient world did not become properly developed but is linked to the Christian world.
And ifhe was not, was I therefore the less his?
My dear ~'lJ!lJtaQavExQW!lEVOL, have I not managed to capture your interest for such a maiden, or shall I resort to a captatio benevolentiae [procedure aimed at gaining the favorable disposition of the judge or listener]?
She lost childhood's illusion when she acquired that of erotic love; she lost erotic love's illusion when Clavigo deceived her; if it were possible for her to acquire sorrow's illusion, she would be helped.
sensual seeks instant satisfaction, and the more refined it is, the better it knows how to make the instant of enjoyment a little eternity.' The true eternity in love, as in true morality, delivers it, therefore, first of all from the sensual.
Generally, people think they are saying something very sagacious when they emphasize that Faust ends up by becoming a Don Juan, and yet it does not say very much, for the point is, in what sense does he become that.
If an ancient esthetician had said that the presuppositions of comedy are character and situation and that its aim is to arouse laughter, then one could very well return to this again and again, but as soon as one pondered how different the causes of laughter are, one would soon be convinced of what an enormous range this requirement has.
When the gods wandered upon the earth and fell in love with women, did they remain faithful to their beloveds?
I recall how smooth and white the cereal was served, how the butter smiled at me, how warm the cereal looked, how hungry I was, how impatient to get permission to begin.
When Don Juan is interpreted musically, I hear in him the total infinitude of passion, but also its infinite power that nothing can resist; I hear the wild craving of desire, but also the absolute victoriousness of this desire, against which any attempted opposition would be ineffectual.
What, then, does recollection do for him?
It is still fresh in our memory that a French statesman, when offered a portfolio the second time, declared that he would accept it but on the condition that the secretary of state be made responsible.
That is why it is quite in order and has deep inner significance that in the seduction that occurs in the play, Zerlina's seduction, the girl is an ordinary peasant girl.
But when sensuality is viewed under the qualification of spirit, its significance is seen to be that it is to be excluded, but precisely because it is to be excluded it is defined as a principle, as a power, for that which spirit, which is itself a principle, is supposed to exclude must be something that manifests itself as a principle, even though it does not manifest itself as a principle until the moment when it is excluded.
What I want to do, however, is in part to illuminate the idea from as many sides as possible and its relation to language and thereby continually to encompass more and more the territory where music is at home, to provoke it, so to speak, to declare itself, without my being able to say, when it can be heard, any more than: Listen.
Why is this, unless for the fact that they have no command over themselves, except in an inverse sense?
Then it is a matter ofhaving vigilance and perseverance and sagacity, for who is as inventive as secret sorrow, but a solitary lifetime prisoner has adequate time to think up many things, and who is as swift to find concealment as secret sorrow, for no young girl can cover in greater anxiety and haste a bosom she has exposed than hidden sorrow when it is surprised.
It is a rare ability; I wonder if it will be appreciated in life?
Antigone is strong; the question is not whether for her own sake, to ease her mind, she should confide her pain to someone, for she can very well endure it without support, but can she defend this to the one who is dead?
A reed pipe?
The music cannot explain why this is so, for it is beyond its power to do that.
How corrupting boredom is, everyone recognizes also with regard to children.
What is going on within her?
-Why can you not grieve?
How empty and meaningless life is.
I am no husband who needs an unusual girl to make me happy; every girl has what makes me happy, and therefore I take them all." That is how the words I touched on earlier must be understood: even coquettes as old as sixty-or in another place: pur che porti la gonel/a, voi sapete que! che fo [if she just wears a skirt, you know well enough what he does].
She curtsied to all the guests, and when the master of the house came forward to greet her, she curtsied very low to him; although her lips parted in a smile, I did not hear a word from her.
Of course, to protest against my thesis that sensuality existed in the world prior to Christianity would be
 
rather foolish, inasmuch as it goes without saying that whatever is to be excluded always exists prior to that which excludes it, even though, understood in another way, it comes into existence [bliver til] only when it is excluded.
What happens in marriage?
Therefore, to say that the opera is immoral is fatuous and comes only from people who do not understand how to interpret a totality but are trapped by details.
Or is a man supposed to be weaker than the weak?
What is essential in Don Juan cannot be presented in ballet, and everyone readily feels how ludicrous it would be to watch DonJuan infatuating a girl by means of dance steps and ingenious gesticulations.
At the hand of the living or the dead?
And yet it occurs to no one to say that they deceived them! And why not?
How handsome he was, his step so light and yet so vigorous, so royal and yet so fugitive; he turned his head to look back, his face so captivating and yet his glance so restless.
Here again is an example of how the musical must be featured in order that Don Juan can be interpreted in his true ideality.
"Can I forget him?
In other words, when language leaves off, music begins; when, as is said, everything is musical, one is not progressing but retrogressing.
When one looks long and attentively at a face, sometimes another face, as it were, is discovered within the face one sees.

On the verge of despair, I suddenly discovered that the man perspired exceptionally much when he spoke.
This notion is just as boring as the tower was high and is a terrible demonstration of how boredom had gained the upper hand.
If I had in my service a submissive jinni who, when I asked for a glass of water, would bring me the world's most expensive wines, deliciously blended, in a goblet, I would dismiss him until he learned that the enjoyment consists not in what I enjoy but in getting my own way.
Such a marriage of convenience may assume a prettier form when the motive is somewhat higher.
Previously, when it merely beckoned, I mounted, light, hearty, and cheerful.
But what does this mean-that where language leaves offI find the musical?
That which occupies us here is the subtlety, the cunning, whereby he knows how to steal into a girl's heart, the dominion he knows how to gain over it, the enthralling, deliberate, progressive seduction.
The bunglers, who think themselves a Don Juan because they have pinched a peasant girl's cheek, put their arms around a waitress, or made a young girl blush, of course understand neither the idea nor Mozart, or
 
The Immediate Erotic Stages
 
how to produce a Don Juan themselves, except as a ludicrous freak, a family idol, who perhaps to the misty, sentimental eyes of some cousins would seem to be a true Don Juan, the epitome of all charm.
As soon as Don Juan is interpreted as a reflective individual, an ideality corresponding to the musical ideality can be attained only when the matter is shifted into the psychological realm.
This is how she encounters him.
Have mercy again on the world; open up once again to gather in everything and keep us all safe in your womb! I greet you, dark night, I greet you as the victor, and this is my comfort, for in eternal oblivion you shorten everything, day and time and life and the irksomeness of recollection!
Since the time when Lessing defined the boundaries between poetry and art in his celebrated treatise Laokoon, it no doubt may be regarded as a conclusion unanimously recognized by all estheticians that the distinction between them is that art is in the category of space, poetry in the category of time, that art depicts repose, poetry motion.
But it is decided, unshakably decided, and she does not need to fear-as is usual with one who is immured alive--that when the scanty ration of bread and water provided her is used up she will perish, for she has nourishment for a long time.
What kind of power is it?
It is a singular feeling when in the midst of enjoyment one looks at it in order to recollect it.
This dress-why is she running?
If so, then it would just have to disintegrate! Can I become someone else, can I be born again of a mother who is not my mother?
What a flock of young girls will run straight into a man's arms when they hear the seductive name: a seducer! Give me half a year, and I will produce a story that will be ever so much more interesting than everything I have so far experienced.
How ridiculous, and what an indirect assault upon marriage! Either marriage has intrinsic reality, and then he is adequately punished by losing it, or it has no reality, and then it is unreasonable to vilify him because he is wiser than others.
Let us strengthen our minds, arm them against the inveiglement of the ear, for what voice is so ingratiating as that of the unhappy one, what voice so bewitching as that of the unhappy one when he is speaking about his own unhappiness.
For through many centuries have not knights and adventurers undergone incredible pains and trouble in order to come to harbor in the quiet peace of a happy marriage?
But this must not be understood as if his sensuousness were blindness; instinctively he knows very well how to make distinctions, and, above all, he idealizes.
For the sake of order, it is probably best to tell first how I happened to come into possession of these papers.
And A's reaction does not surprise me, for I, too, who have nothing at all to do with this narrative-indeed, am twice removed from the original author-I, too, sometimes have felt quite strangely uneasy when I have been occupied with these papers in the stillness of the night.
He was playing with some young girls, all of them at that dangerous age when they are neither adults nor children.
It actually exists only when it is being performed.
" Or when he makes the remark that his master is a disbeliever not only in love but also in medicine.
The more abstract and thus the more impoverished the idea is, the more abstract and thus the more impoverished the medium is; hence the greater is the probability that no repetition can be imagined, and the greater is the probability that when the idea has acquired its expression it has acquired it once and for all.
A monologue is always more or less a break with the dramatic, and when the poet tries to produce an effect by the wittiness of the monologue rather than by its character, he has broken the rod on himself and has relinquished the dramatic interest.
It shows how thoroughly reflective this age is, that it must help itself out with such a compromise as a marriage of convenience.
Moreover, when I use the term "stage" as I did and continue to do, it must not be taken to mean that each stage exists independently, the one outside the other.
There are people whose make-up is so constituted that when their emotions are stirred the blood rushes to the surface of the skin, and in this way the interior motion becomes visible in the exterior; others are so constituted that the blood recedes, withdraws into the heart chamber and the inner parts of the organism.
What more, after all, do they salvage from life's huge conflagration?
And was  not?
Which is the more amazing-that no corpse was found or that the grave was opened?
Music does not exist except in the moment it is performed, for even if a person can read notes ever so well and has an ever so vivid imagination, he still cannot deny that only in a figurative sense does music exist when it is being read.
You friendly jinn who protect all innocent love, I commit my

whole mind to you; guard my laboring thoughts so that they may be found worthy of the subject; form my soul into a euphonious instrument; let the gentle breeze of eloquence hasten over it; send the refreshment and blessing of fruitful moods! You righteous spirits, you who guard the boundaries of the kingdom of beauty, guard me lest I, in confused enthusiasm and blind zeal to make Don Giovanni all in all, do it an injustice, disparage it, make it something other than what it really is, which is the highest! You powerful spirits who know how to grasp men's hearts, stand by me so that I may capture the reader, not in the net of passion or the wiles of eloquence, but in the eternal truth of conviction.
A dialectical qualification that must be strictly maintained is this:
 
only when there is an object is there desire; only when there is desire is there an object.
And when he speaks it is nothing new he has to say, and when he has spoken the individuals humble themselves under it., but at the same time are uplifted just because they are assured that what he enjoins is what they themselves wish, and that his commanding it is merely a more majestic, a more exalted, a divine
 
way of expressing the fact that their wish can be realized.
If it is strictly understood, the result will be to argue the very opposite of what was really intended, as is always the case when one moves abstractly in dialectical qualifications, where it is the case that one not only says one thing and means something else but says something else; what one thinks one is saying one does not say but says the opposite.
This pale, hazy image-is this the Faust I worshipped?
If a person possessed a letter that he knew or believed contained information about what he had to consider his life's happiness, but the characters were thin and faint and the handwriting almost illegible, then, presumably with anxiety and agitation, he would read it most passionately again and again and at one moment derive one meaning, at the next moment another, according to how he would explain everything by a word he believed that he had deciphered with certainty, but he would never progress beyond the same uncertainty with which he had begun.
Nothing! Clay in his hands, a rib from which he formed me! What was I?
Looking back for a moment over what has been developed here, the reader will perhaps perceive how here again the relation of the idea of Don Juan to the musical has been developed from many sides, how this relation is constitutive of the whole opera, how this is repeated in its several parts.
The comic lies precisely in the isolation; when one wants to affirm the tragic within this isolation, one has evil in its badness, not the authentic tragic guilt in its ambiguous guiltlessness.
When a possibility is shattered, the momentary pain may not be as great, but frequently it also leaves a little ligament or two whole and undamaged, which remains a constant occasion for continued pain.
Perhaps I could easily have deleted an occasional negligence, which is quite understandable when one considers that he is merely a letter writer.
Language is the perfect medium precisely when everything sensuous in it is negated.
The first doubt with which pain really begins is this: Why is this happening to me; can it not be otherwise?
Thus Dr. Hartley has observed: dass wenn sich das Lachen zuerst bei Kindem zeiget, so ist es ein entstehendes Weinen, welches durch Schmerz erregt wird, oder ein plotzlich gehemtes und in sehr kurzen Zwischenraiimen wiederholtes Gefiihl des Schmerzens [that when laughter first makes its appearance in the child, it is a nascent cry that is excited by pain or a suddenly arrested feeling of pain repeated at very short intervals (see Flogel, Geschichte der comischen Litteratur, I, p.
When David really wanted to feel his power and glory, he had his people counted; in our age, however, it may be said that the people, in order to feel their significance over against a superior power, count themselves.
He does not have that kind of continuance at all but hurries on in an eternal vanishing, just like the music, which is over as soon as the sound has stopped and comes into existence again only when it sounds once again.
What was I?
Farewell, then, you the unhappiest one! But what am I saying-"the unhappiest"?
Indeed it is, for my suffering and anguish prove to me how happy I was, so happy that he has no idea of it.
Can anything more boring be imagined?
Thus when Kruse has Don Giovanni, as he comes onstage at Zerlina's wedding, say, "Cheer up, children! You are indeed all dressed as for a wedding," he is saying something entirely appropriate and also something more than he perhaps thinks.
Don Giovanni is interested in her before the opera begins; the spectator bestows on her his dramatic interest; but we friends of grief, we accompany her not only to the nearest cross street, not only in the moment when she walks across the stage-no, we accompany her on her solitary way.
I am predestined; fate laughs at me when it suddenly shows me how everything I do to resist becomes a factor in such an existence [Tilva'relse].
But might they not therefore be able- to look lovingly at one another?
Who is the lucky one to whom it is offered?
What am I that I dare to be so bold?
Because of its pride, the egotistically proud love regards a deception as impossible; it is not concerned with finding out what can be said for or against, how the person concerned can be defended or excused; it is absolutely sure, because it is too proud to believe that anyone would dare to deceive it.
When sentimental people, who as such are very boring, become peevish, they are often amusing.
I do not know how to describe her passion other than as love's hate, a mixed but nevertheless sonorous, resonant passion.
Why was I not born in Nyboder,  why did I not die as a baby?
See how he hurries; he has longed for me; it is as ifhe threw everything aside in order to come to me as soon as possible.
Here one sees what I mean when I say that Don Giovanni resonates in Elvira, that it is something more than a phrase.
I had arrived before she did, had already been waiting some time when I stepped to the window to see whether she was coming, and a moment later her carriage stopped at the door.
Heiberg was indirectly influenced by Mozart's interpretation to see-namely, how Don Juan must be interpreted as soon as music is not made its proper expression or he is placed in completely different esthetic categories.
Therefore, when so many admire Greek tragedy, it no doubt is often just parroting, for it is obvious that our age at least has no great sympathy for what is the truly Greek sorrow.
Indeed, he was not married to me; we had not received the blessing of the Church; the bell had not rung for us; no hymn was sung-and yet what was all the music and celebration of the Church; how would it be able to put me in a mood comparable to this anxiety! -But then he came, and the disharmony of my anxiety dissolved into the most blissful harmony of security, and only faint tremblings voluptuously stirred my soul.
If! pick up a silhouette, I have no impression of it, cannot arrive at an actual conception of it; only when I hold it up toward the wall and do not look at it directly but at what appears on the wall, only then do I see it.
Hear how he plunges down into the multiplicity of life, how he breaks against its solid embankment.
There is a folk book, the title of which is rather familiar even though the book itself is little used, which is especially strange in our age when everybody is so engrossed in the idea of Faust.
Generally you think of what you call "the visible sacred symbol of the erotic," which, as you say, "like all signs or tokens, has in itself no importance but depends for its significance upon the energy, the artistic bravura and virtuosity, themselves proofs of inborn genius, with which it is executed." "How disgusting it is," you say, "to see the languor with which such things are performed in married life, how perfunctorily, how sluggishly it is done, almost at the stroke of the clock-pretty much as among the tribe the Jesuits discovered in Paraguay, which was so sluggish that the Jesuits found it necessary to ring a bell at midnight as a welcome notice to all husbands, to remind them thereby of their marital duties.
With her depth of soul, when she ever falls in love, she is bound to love with an extraordinary passion.
Marie Beaumarchais
The girl taken as our subject is known to us in Goethe's Clavigo, except that we shall follow her a little further in time, when she has lost dramatic interest, when the accompaniments of sorrow have gradually abated.
Which was the true voice?
Or is there anyone who would be boring enough to contradict me in this regard?
And yet was not this anxiety part of it?
When once there awakens an apprehension of love's proper dialectic, an apprehension of its pathological struggle, of its relation to the ethical, to the religious, verily one will not have need of hard-hearted fathers or ladies' bowers, or enchanted princesses or ogres and monsters in order to give love plenty to do.
Unfinished papers are like a ruin, and what place of resort could be more natural for the buried?
From that I concluded that my wish was granted and decided that the gods knew how to express themselves with good taste, for it would indeeq have been inappropriate to reply solemnly: It is granted to yoU.
So it goes with the individual also when he, perhaps extracted from the womb of time laboriously enough, wants to be absolute in this enormous relativity.
Of course, she is! But how is this grief to be characterized?
Is that, then, a consolation for me?
My soul is like the Dead Sea, over which no bird is able to fly; when it has come midway, it sinks down, exhausted, to death and destruction.
Is consideration being given to any means of amusement?
For is it not ingenious and significant that the floor of this little room is strewn, as is the local custom, with foliage, as if for a funeral; and is not nature itself giving us its approval when we take note of the wild storm raging around us, when we pay heed to the wind's powerful voice?
Should the reader, therefore, after familiarizing himself with the contents, find that the titles were not felicitously chosen, I shall always be willing to put up with the pain inherent in having done something wrong when one wanted to do something well.
There have been times when I would have given everything for a ticket; now I do not even need to pay one rix-dollar for a ticket.
She need not fear that they will surround her too closely-indeed, they know very well how to open ranks in order to expedite her departure.
No! Did he promise me anything?
What, after all, do these busy bustlers achieve?
What reason can there be to exclude music in order thereby to make words alone predominant?
When the sea heaves and is rough, the seething waves in their turbulence form pictures resembling creatures; it seems as if it were these creatures that set the waves in motion, and yet it is, conversely, the swelling waves that form them.
Has not the bond that in the political sense held the states together, invisibly and spiritually, dissolved; has not the power in religion that insisted upon the invisible been weakened and destroyed; do not our statesmen and clergymen have this in common, that they, like the augurs of old, cannot look at one another without smiling?
Therefore she has nowhere to turn except to him; only by being in his presence can she hold off despair, either by stifling the inner voices with the uproar of hate and rage, which sound in full force only when Don Giovanni is personally present, or by hoping.
When I think about it now, it seems to me that such an appointment was just the thing for me.
Would not this inverted story of responsibility be an appropriate subject for Aristophanes! On the other hand, why are the government and the governors so afraid of assuming responsibility, unless it is because they fear an opposition party that in turn continually pushes away responsibility on a similar scale.
As a ship is saluted with a cannonade when it is launched, so I would salute myself.
When he is on the verge of despair, I will give it all back to him again, but he will have me to thank for it-and then I shall be avenged.
It is a comfort to me that Diana, who had not given birth herself, came to the aid of women in labor-indeed, that she had this ability from infancy as an inborn gift, so that when she was born she herself helped Latona in her labor pains.
The point here, of course, is not to see a single individual in the Page, something one is so easily tempted to do when in thought or in actuality the Page is represented by a person.
If I found such a one, she would appeal to me from the standpoint of her being a rarity; but from the standpoint of a long period of time she would not appeal to me, for either she would continually remain faithful, and then I would become a sacrifice to my eagerness for experience, since I would have to bear with her, or the time would come when she would lapse, and then I would have the same old story.
In another place, B mentions a Greek wise man by the name of Myson and relates that he enjoyed the rare good fortune of being counted among the seven sages, when their number is set at fourteen.
But, then, which idea is the most abstract?
Is it courage that I lack?
And what are all the gods of Olympus compared with my Giovanni?
The Elementary Originality of the Sensuous Qualified as Seduction
When the idea of Don Juan emerged is not known; only this much is certain-that it is linked to Christianity and through Christianity to the Middle Ages.
That is why even friendship is dangerous, marriage even more so.
How unfortunate! My doubting soul perhaps would have been captivated by it, by the language as well as by the content.
When you were with me, they obeyed your suggestions; then I played with them as a child; I braided a wreath of them and put them on my head; I let them flow like my hair, ruffled in the wind.
Otherwise, how could he stop loving me?
How, then, did it exist?
And where can this better be found than in a young girl, and how can he more completely imbibe this than in the embrace of erotic love?
Why, then, do I complain because a man is not like a woman, not as happy as she is when she is happy, not as unhappy as she is when she is boundlessly unhappy because her happiness knew no bounds.
When he woke up an hour later, she was gone.
Why, then, did he assure me in the beginning that he loved me so much?
How he deceived Elvira, by what means he lured her out of the convent, all this we presumably are to learn from a few of Sganarelle' s lines, but since the seduction scene that occurs in the play does not give us an occasion to admire Don Juan's art, confidence in those reports is naturally weakened.
Now, if Sganarelle feels indissolubly linked to him, it is no more than a reasonable esthetic demand to insist on information about how this can be explained.
It is a splendid vintage from the Middle Ages, and, when it is opened, such an aromatic, delicious, and distinctive fragrance flows forth that one has a very special feeling.
"He was no deceiver, because in order to be that, he would have had to be conscious of it himself from the beginning, but that he was not; my heart tells me that he loved me." If the concept of a deceiver is advanced in this way, then perhaps, when all is said and done, a deceiver has never lived.
But this is by no means so; the vigor, the courage, that wants to be the creator of its own good fortune in this way, indeed, its own creator, is an illusion, and when the age loses the tragic, it gains despair.
This is everywhere the case when the objective sorrow in itself is not finished, when it leaves a doubt, whatever its nature is.
How she found out is extraneous to the tragic interest, and in that respect everyone is left to his own explanation.
The fault is that this struggle, this dialectic, is entirely external, and that love comes out of this fight quite as abstract as when it entered into it.
Like everyone else, he knows how dearly she loves her father.
He did not love me anymore; that is why he left me, but that, after all, was no deception.
I feel an anxiety, an unspeakable anxiety, an anxiety such as I felt in the convent when I sat in my solitary cell and waited for him and my thoughts terrified me: the prioress's intense scorn, the convent's terrible punishment, my offense against God.
See how they press forward in countless numbers, all the unhappy ones.
When an actuality is shattered, the break is usually far more radical; every nerve is cut, and the break as a break has an implicit completeness.
It was not because he was an extraordinary person that she loved him, far from it; she was very aware of his faults, but she believed he was a good man, a faithful man, and that was why she loved him.
This is especially effective when the feelings are in motion.
--What are the sure signs of friendship?
On the whole, with real genius, Mozart has had Leporello reproduce Don Giovanni and thereby has achieved two things: the musical effect that whenever Leporello is alone one hears Don Giovanni, and the parodical effect that when Don Giovanni is present we hear Leporello repeat him and thereby unconsciously parody him.
When I remember poetically, my experience has already undergone the change of having lost everything painful.
Did you not know it beforehand?
Look over there, what a beautiful union! The one generation offers a hand to the other! Is it an invitation to blessing, to faithful solidarity, to a happy dance?
Just when this moment arrives is difficult to determine, but it proclaims itself in a mysterious way; one feels it and can no longer say De to the other.
Should we interrupt them in this; should we wish for them the return of what was lost; would that be an advantage for them?
Or do we not all stand like Noureddin, bowing and scraping, worrying about asking too much or too little?
But when he is conceived in music, then I do not have the particular individual, then I have a force of nature, the demonic, which no more wearies of se-

ducing or is through with seducing than the wind with blowing a gale, the sea with rocking, or a waterfall with plunging down from the heights.
In the tragic there is implicit a sadness and a healing that one indeed must not disdain, and when someone wishes to gain himself in the superhuman way our age tries to do it, he loses himself  and becomes comic.
Just as when a girl resolves to sacrifice her life for an idea, when she stands there with the sacrificial wreath on her forehead, she stands as a bride, for the great animating idea transforms her, and the sacrificial wreath is like the bridal wreath.
What instrument is it?
He needs no preparation, no plan, no time, for he is always ready; that is, the power is always in him, and the desire also, and only when he desires is he properly in his element.
What philosophers say about actuality [Virkelighed] is often just as disappointing  as it is when one reads on a sign in a secondhand shop: Pressing Done Here.
That Byron was in many ways particularly endowed to present a Don Juan is certain enough, and therefore one can be sure that when that undertaking failed, the reason was not in Byron but in something far deeper.
Sganarelle's monologue is far from unwitty, and when it is read in Prof.
I dressed quickly and was already at the door when the thought crossed my mind: Do you have enough money in your pocketbook?
This is why all the finite differences vanish for him in comparison with the main point: to be a woman.
But am I not indebted to him at all when I hate him?
After all, is it not beautiful to imagine that two beings are meant for one another?
I prefer to talk with children, for one may still dare to hope that they may become rational beings; but those who have become that-good Lord!lO How unreasonable people are! They never use the freedoms they have but demand those they do not have; they have freedom of thought-they demand freedom of speech.
Yet one does not want to be so isolated, so unnatural, that one does not regard the family as a whole of which it can be said that when one member suffers, then they all suffer.
She feels how much has been placed into her hands, and this gives her the preternatural magnitude that is necessary in order for her to engage us tragically.
Where did this girl belong?
It is common knowledge that the first question in the first and most compendious instruction given to a child is this: What does baby want?
Who is to blame for it?
When my physician prescribes a diet for me, there is some reason in that; I abstain from certain specified foods for a certain specified time.
Indeed, how many are there in our day who truly dare to wish, dare to desire, dare to address nature neither with a polite child's bitte, bitte [please, please] nor with the raging frenzy of one damned?
The most abstract idea conceivable is the sensuous! in its elemental originality [Genialitet]Y But through which medium can it be presented?
I never dream when I sleep; that would be a shame, because to sleep is the height of genius.
!Os And what could divert me?
From what was the chain formed that bound the Fenris wolf?
Is she sorrowing?
Can I demand more?
The Mozartian music was in no respect too narrow; on the contrary, their own moods were expanded, took on a preternatural magnitude when they rediscovered them in Mozart.
And just as the Greek Antigone cannot bear to have her brother's body thrown away without the last honors, so she feels how harsh it would have been if no one had come to know this; it troubles her that not a tear would have been shed, and she almost thanks the gods because she has been selected as this instrument.
I shall, however, continually track down the musical in the idea, the situation, etc., explore it by listening, and when I have brought the reader to the point of being so musically receptive that he seems to hear the music although he hears nothing, then I shall have fmished my task, then I shall fall silent, then I shall say to the reader, as I say to myself: Listen.
But then what makes this situation into a musical situation?
It can elude our attention for a long time, but when by chance a look, a word, a sigh, a tone in the voice, a hint in the eyes, a trembling of the lips, or a blunder in the handshake treacherously betrays what has been carefully concealed-then passion is aroused, then the struggle begins.

PART I
CONTAINING A'S PAPERS
Is reason then alone baptised, are the passions pagans?
What, if anything, is the meaning of this life?
But when the battle is won, when the last echo of the last shot has died away, when the swift thoughts, like a staff officer hurrying back to headquarters, report that the victory is yours-then, in fact, you know nothing more, you know not how to begin; for then, for the first time, you are at the true beginning.
When she thinks of the cold cunning, the shabby commonsensicality it took to deceive her in such a way that it does not look so bad in the eyes of the world, so that she becomes prey to the sympathy that says, "Well, good Lord, it isn't so terrible," she is shocked, she can almost go insane at the thought of the proud superiority for which she has meant nothing at all, which has set a limit for her and said, "Up to here and no further." And yet the whole thing can also be explained in another, a more beautiful, way.
If it is moved, it merely skims along the ground, just as birds fly low when a thunderstorm is blowing up.
"Never lose courage! When troubles pile up most appallingly about you, you will see a helping hand in the clouds"so said His Reverence Jesper Morten  at vespers recently.
Now, when the horse is covered with lather and is almost ready to drop, it seems to me that I do not move from the spot.
When sensuousness manifests itself as that which must be excluded, as that with which the spirit does not wish to be involved, but when spirit has not as yet convicted it or condemned it, sensuousness takes this form, is the demonic in esthetic indifference.
It by no means follows that one must regard it as the devil's work, even though one detects with a certain secret horror that this art, more than any other art, frequently torments its devotees in a terrible way, a phenomenon, strangely enough, that seems to have escaped the attention of the psychologists and the mass, except on a particular occasion when they are alarmed by a desperate individual's scream of anxiety.
What was my love for him without it?
I was unfaithful to my first love, and now should I make up for it by being unfaithful to my second?
In the cloister?
That anxiety is a reflection category is shown by language itself, for I always say that I am anxious about something, and I thereby distinguish between the anxiety and that about which I am anxious, and I can never use "anxiety" objectively; whereas when I say "my sorrow," I can be expressing as much about what I am grieving over as about my sorrow over it.
It must be as a warning, and all the more so since everyone must be gripped by a certain sadness because no matter how much the world has changed, the idea of the tragic is still essentially unchanged, just as weeping still continues to be equally natural to humankind.
Taking it all in all, it is remarkable how voracious modern poetry is, and for a long time it has been living on nothing else but love.
Can anything worse be imagined?
Moreover, it has often occurred to me to wonder why, according, to the universal usage and way of thinking, the state of single blessedness has no such brilliant prospects, that on the contrary, people rather turn it to ridicule when a bachelor celebrates a jubilee.
That words, when they are misused, can confuse the mindjust as much as music, all revivalist sects will surely admit.
Since it is important with respect to Margarete's grief, we shall now consider more closely how Faust presumably must have affected her.
Anyone who has ever made the laughter of others and his own the object of observation, who has had in mind, as in this project, not so much the accidental as the universal, who has perceived with psychological interest how different the occasion oflaughter is at every age--that person will readily be convinced that the unchangeable requirement for comedy, that it must arouse laughter, in itself implies a high degree of changeableness in relation to the ideas of the laughable in the varying world consciousness, yet without this difference being so diffuse that the corresponding expression in the somatic functions would be that laughter would manifest itself in weeping.
But what can more truthfully be called a woman's life than her love?
That is why she is dangerous to him.
The spoken lines, which are either Schikaneder's or the Danish translator's, are generally so lunatic and foolish that it is almost incomprehensible how Mozart has brought as
 
much out of them as he has done.
How often one has felt the need of reaching out beyond the historical consciousness, a longing, a nostalgia for the primeval forest which lies behind us.
In grammar school, when I was fifteen years old, I wrote very suavely on demonstrations for the existence of God and the immortality of the soul, on the concept of faith, and on the meaning of miracles.
And if she perhaps cannot force back the tears, then she is sure to be misunderstood; then perhaps she cries herself out, for when one lives in an ecclesia pressa [persecuted church], it is truly a joy that one's divine service harmonizes in its mode of expression with the public mode.
Why is it my confidant?
He has friends-how, then, does he come to be here?
As long as she is in the vicinity of Don Giovanni, she is beside herself; when she comes to herself, it is appropriate to think about the paradox.
It makes no pompous display, and yet sometimes there is shed over it a luster which does not interrupt its customary course, as when the moonbeams fall upon the water and reveal the instrument upon which it plays its melody.
Here the dialectical difficulty is obvious, for what is she sorrowing over?
But if one takes the first aria into consideration, then one presumably will approve the predicates I have used and, if one pays closer attention, will also have the opportunity to see what importance the musical has where it appears as the absolute expression for the idea and how this as a consequence is immediate-musical.
Why was she so beautiful-I could murder her-why am  not just as beautiful?
Yes, lovable Margarete! Goethe betrayed how you plucked the petals and recited the words: He loves me, he loves me not.
And should I not be proud-should I disparage him, should I insult him in my thought, allow it to force him into the narrow, wretched laws that apply to ordinary men?
Hence, when one finds in our times a strong disposition to abolish marriage, this is not as in the Middle Ages because the unmarried life is regarded as more perfect, but the reason of it is cowardice and self indulgence.
Then I would just have to cease to be!
"Can I bring him to mind?
But if, as has been observed above, the overture can be regarded as a running start to the opera, if in the overture one descends from that higher atmosphere, then the question is: at what point is it best for one to land in the opera, or how is the begining of the opera achieved?
How monotonous, and yet how rich in change! Such is the home life of marriage: quiet, modest, purling-it has not many changements and et like that water it purls, yet like that water it has melody, dear to the man who knows it, dear to him above all other sounds because he knows it.
A tragic turn cannot very well be produced when the idea is perceived to be wholly unjustified, and therefore the comic is so close at hand.
What is the voice, then-is it a stroke of the tongue, a noise that one can produce as one wishes?
And why does it not rage even more violently and put an end to life and the world and this short speech, which at least has the merit exceeding everything else that it is soon ended.
Yea, so long as every nerve in you is aquiver, whether when you are stealing softly about, or when you step out boldly and Janizary music within you drowns out your consciousness-then you feel that you are living.
See now if you can come to the far more important matter of demonstrating that Don Giovanni is a classic work, for I admit that this would be a really appropriate introduction to the exploration proper." To what extent it would be an appropriate introduction, I shall leave in abeyance, but the trouble here for me is that I in turn cannot appreciate him, for no matter how easy it may be for me to demonstrate it, it would still never occur to me to demonstrate it.
But when the hoping individuality wants to hope for a future time that nevertheless can acquire no reality for him, or the recollecting individuality wants to recollect a time that has had no reality, then we have essentially unhappy individualities.
How much more, then, those who have understood him perfectly, how much more must they feel happy with the fortunate one.
Have you observed that there is also another sort of neurasthenia?
Although it can thus be truly said that Don Giovanni is a seducer, this term, which can easily confuse the weak brains of some estheticians, frequently gives occasion for misunderstanding when some random comments that could be said about such a person and have been scraped together then are automatically transferred to Don Giovanni.
Thus, when the book is read, A and B are forgotten; only the points of view confront each other and expect no final decision in the particular personalities.
Have not novelists and novel readers worked their way through one volume after another in order to stop with a happy marriage?
Or is this not the striking feature of everything that originates in that happy people l-a depression of spirit, a sadness in their art, in their poetry, in their life, in theirjoy?
"Can I grieve?
That which, generally speaking, should be the content of this little exploration will not be so much the relation between the tragic in ancient and in modern drama as it will be an attempt to show how the characteristic feature of the tragic in ancient drama is incorporated in the tragic in modern drama in such a way that what is truly tragic will become apparent.
What, after all, did Nero achieve?
The more meaningful that was which she leaves, the more firmly must she cling to him; the more firmly she has embraced him, the more terrible becomes her despair when he leaves her.
The more consistently a person knows how to sustain his arbitrariness, the more amusing the combinations become.
Their beauty passes away like a dream and like yesterday when it is past.
The more profound natures, who were moved by the idea, found everything, even the softest breeze, expressed in Mozart's music; in its grandiose passion, they found a full-toned expression for what stirred in their own inner beings, they perceived how every mood strained toward that music just as the brook hurries on in order to lose itself in the infinitude of the sea.
We shout to the whole world, and when it approaches us in a friendly manner we say, "It was not this Maren." My life is like an eternal night; when I die, I shall be able to say with Achilles:

Du bist vollbracht, Nachtwache meines Daseyns [You are fulfilled, nightwatch of my life].
If so, its flight would just have to come to an end! Can the raindrop, however far it falls, forget the heaven from which it fell?
Developed and elaborated in this way, Antigone can engage us, I believe, and I believe that you will not reproach me for frivolousness or paternal prejudice when I believe that she might very well venture into the tragic line and appear in a tragedy.
My heart pounded when I went into the shop.
"Did he deceive me?
Thus, when Philoctetes laments that he lives abandoned and solitary on a desolate island, his remark also has external truth; when, however, our Antigone feels pain in her solitude, it is only figuratively that she is alone, but for this very reason, only then is her pain truly literal.
The same thing is manifest when one observes the other force-that is, it gradually increases; it begins in the overture, grows and increases.
Can anything more boring be imagined, both for the honorable delegates as well as for one who will read and hear about them?
Then, when he has read the book, he can perhaps think of the title.
This no doubt says very much when it is understood properly, but very little when it is interpreted with a certain customary vagueness.
When a spider flings itself from a fixed point down into its consequences, it continually sees before it an empty space in which it can find no foothold, however much it stretches.
We have seen how this immediate and beautiful but also very naive love, being embodied in the consciousness of a reflective age, must become the object of its mockery and of its irony; and we have seen too what such an age was capable of substituting for it.
Therefore, one is inclined to shut the eyes when listening to music.
When one imagines these two powers face to face with each other but unable to catch hold of each other because the one is always disappearing and is replaced by the other, the one merely appearing in the role of the other-such a situation would certainly not be without comic power.
Is not recollection really the point of such a wedding?
An element of guilt always remains, but this element is not actually reflected subjectively; this is why the sorrow in Greek tragedy is so profound.
No one asks when one wants to come in; no one asks when one wants to go out.
So when I say that my maxim is not a point of departure for me, this does not have the opposite of being a point of departure but is merely the negative expression of my maxim, that by which it comprehends itself in contrast to being a point of departure or not being a point of departure.
Have I, then, stopped loving him?
