Therefore, when selecting a nursemaid, one always considers essentially not only that she is sober, trustworthy, and good-natured but also takes into esthetic consideration whether she knows how to entertain children.
You will, perhaps, make answer that this remedy is no remedy; but to that I will remark that it depends upon how one looks at the matter.
When I remember poetically, my experience has already undergone the change of having lost everything painful.
They sense that it is inappropriate to go on declaring that she is going to die when she continues to live; in addition, they do not feel able to do it with the same pathos-filled energy as at the beginning, and yet this was a prerequisite if there was to be any solace for her.
Therefore, to say that the opera is immoral is fatuous and comes only from people who do not understand how to interpret a totality but are trapped by details.
But this must not be understood as if his sensuousness were blindness; instinctively he knows very well how to make distinctions, and, above all, he idealizes.
Fie on them! That is why my soul always turns back to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare.
Thus Dr. Hartley has observed: dass wenn sich das Lachen zuerst bei Kindem zeiget, so ist es ein entstehendes Weinen, welches durch Schmerz erregt wird, oder ein plotzlich gehemtes und in sehr kurzen Zwischenraiimen wiederholtes Gefiihl des Schmerzens [that when laughter first makes its appearance in the child, it is a nascent cry that is excited by pain or a suddenly arrested feeling of pain repeated at very short intervals (see Flogel, Geschichte der comischen Litteratur, I, p.
Now, if Sganarelle feels indissolubly linked to him, it is no more than a reasonable esthetic demand to insist on information about how this can be explained.
Philoctetes' reflection is not absorbed in itself, and it is genuinely Greek when he laments that no one knows his pain.
I shall, however, continually track down the musical in the idea, the situation, etc., explore it by listening, and when I have brought the reader to the point of being so musically receptive that he seems to hear the music although he hears nothing, then I shall have fmished my task, then I shall fall silent, then I shall say to the reader, as I say to myself: Listen.
The person who is grieving finds relief, and the sympathetic knight of grief rejoices over having found what he sought, for we seek not the present but the past, not joy, for it is always present, but sorrow, for its nature is to pass by, and in the present moment we see it just as we see a person when we catch sight of him for just a moment and then he turns down another street and disappears.
When B supposes that out of a hundred people who go astray in the world ninety-nine are saved by women and one by divine grace,  it is easy to see that he is not very good in mathematics, inasmuch as he gives no place to those who are actually lost.
You friendly jinn who protect all innocent love, I commit my
 
The Immediate Erotic Stages
 
whole mind to you; guard my laboring thoughts so that they may be found worthy of the subject; form my soul into a euphonious instrument; let the gentle breeze of eloquence hasten over it; send the refreshment and blessing of fruitful moods! You righteous spirits, you who guard the boundaries of the kingdom of beauty, guard me lest I, in confused enthusiasm and blind zeal to make Don Giovanni all in all, do it an injustice, disparage it, make it something other than what it really is, which is the highest! You powerful spirits who know how to grasp men's hearts, stand by me so that I may capture the reader, not in the net of passion or the wiles of eloquence, but in the eternal truth of conviction.
So then the moment remains the principal thing, and how often one has I heard these shameless words addressed by such a lover to a poor girl who could love only once: "I do not demand so much, I am content with less; far be it from me to require that you shall continue to love me to all eternity, if only you love me at the instant when I wish it." Such lovers know very well that the sensuous is transient, they know also what is the most beautiful instant and therewith they are content.
So it goes with the individual also when he, perhaps extracted from the womb of time laboriously enough, wants to be absolute in this enormous relativity.
Hence, when one finds in our times a strong disposition to abolish marriage, this is not as in the Middle Ages because the unmarried life is regarded as more perfect, but the reason of it is cowardice and self indulgence.
She is sure prey for a Don Giovanni; he will know how to coax out the passion-wild, ungovernable, insatiable, to be satisfied only in his love.
How corrupting boredom is, everyone recognizes also with regard to children.
We have now seen how romantic love was built upon an illusion, that the eternity it claims was built upon the temporal, and that although the knight of romantic love was sincerely convinced of its absolute durability, there nevertheless was no certainty of this, inasmuch as its trials and temptations have hitherto been in a medium which was entirely external.
Therefore she has nowhere to turn except to him; only by being in his presence can she hold off despair, either by stifling the inner voices with the uproar of hate and rage, which sound in full force only when Don Giovanni is personally present, or by hoping.
Let us strengthen our minds, arm them against the inveiglement of the ear, for what voice is so ingratiating as that of the unhappy one, what voice so bewitching as that of the unhappy one when he is speaking about his own unhappiness.
See now if you can come to the far more important matter of demonstrating that Don Giovanni is a classic work, for I admit that this would be a really appropriate introduction to the exploration proper." To what extent it would be an appropriate introduction, I shall leave in abeyance, but the trouble here for me is that I in turn cannot appreciate him, for no matter how easy it may be for me to demonstrate it, it would still never occur to me to demonstrate it.
" Or when he makes the remark that his master is a disbeliever not only in love but also in medicine.
It never occurs to him how beautiful it is that true greatness is common to all, that a farmhand goes to Tribler's widow  or to a ballad-monger on Halmtorv  and reads it half aloud to himself at the same time Goethe is writing a Faust.
How is a friend defined?
Here again is an example of how the musical must be featured in order that Don Juan can be interpreted in his true ideality.

See how they press forward in countless numbers, all the unhappy ones.
When he woke up an hour later, she was gone.
That is why she is dangerous to him.
There is also something else, however, in married life which you characterize by the word "custom": "its monotony," you say, "the total lack of events, its everlasting vacuity, which is death and worse than death." You know that there are neurasthenics who may be disturbed by the slightest noise, who are unable to think when someone is walking softly across the floor.
Sganarelle's monologue is far from unwitty, and when it is read in Prof.
Just as the Middle Ages had tales of sorcerers who knew how to prepare a rejuvenating potion and used the heart of an innocent child for it, so this is the strengthening his emaciated soul needs, the only thing that can satisfy him for a moment.
He does not have that kind of continuance at all but hurries on in an eternal vanishing, just like the music, which is over as soon as the sound has stopped and comes into existence again only when it sounds once again.
For example, when it is said of Jehovah that he is ajealous God, that he visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations,  or when we hear those terrible curses in the Old Testament, one could easily be tempted to want to seek tragic material here.
No, surely he was no deceiver, and how could that voice deceive?
Why is this, unless for the fact that they have no command over themselves, except in an inverse sense?
To run into such difficulties at the very moment when the coachman's enticing tones were still ringing in my ears! The blood rushed to my head; I was furious.
Therefore, when I see a fly settle on the nose of one of those men of business in a decisive moment, or ifhe is splashed by a carriage that passes him in even greater haste, or Knippelsbr  tilts up, or a roof tile falls and kills him,  I laugh from the bottom of my heart.
In other words, when language leaves off, music begins; when, as is said, everything is musical, one is not progressing but retrogressing.
The formula is as follows: when two quantities are equal in size to one and the same third quantity, they are all of equal size.
How often one has felt the need of reaching out beyond the historical consciousness, a longing, a nostalgia for the primeval forest which lies behind us.
Think of our school days; we were at an age when there was no esthetic consideration in the choosing of our teachers, and therefore they were often very boring--how resourceful we were then! What fun we had catching a fly, keeping it prisoner under a nutshell, and watching it run around with it! What delight in cutting a hole in the desk, confining a fly in it, and peeking at it through a piece of paper! How entertaining it can be to listen to the monotonous dripping from the roof! What a meticulous observer one becomes, detecting every little sound or movement.
It is a splendid vintage from the Middle Ages, and, when it is opened, such an aromatic, delicious, and distinctive fragrance flows forth that one has a very special feeling.
To forget--this is the desire of all people, and when they encounter something unpleasant, they always say: If only I could forget! But to forget is an art that must be practiced in advance.
I do not know how to describe her passion other than as love's hate, a mixed but nevertheless sonorous, resonant passion.
The fault is that this struggle, this dialectic, is entirely external, and that love comes out of this fight quite as abstract as when it entered into it.
But when the battle is won, when the last echo of the last shot has died away, when the swift thoughts, like a staff officer hurrying back to headquarters, report that the victory is yours-then, in fact, you know nothing more, you know not how to begin; for then, for the first time, you are at the true beginning.
So because you do not believe in it, you dare not enter into an alliance which, when you no longer are volens may compel you nolens to remain in it.
That is why it is quite in order and has deep inner significance that in the seduction that occurs in the play, Zerlina's seduction, the girl is an ordinary peasant girl.
But when the hoping individuality wants to hope for a future time that nevertheless can acquire no reality for him, or the recollecting individuality wants to recollect a time that has had no reality, then we have essentially unhappy individualities.
Of course, to protest against my thesis that sensuality existed in the world prior to Christianity would be
 
rather foolish, inasmuch as it goes without saying that whatever is to be excluded always exists prior to that which excludes it, even though, understood in another way, it comes into existence [bliver til] only when it is excluded.
In order to be able to recollect in this way, one must be very much aware of how one lives, especially of how one enjoys.
If it is moved, it merely skims along the ground, just as birds fly low when a thunderstorm is blowing up.
Moreover, when I use the term "stage" as I did and continue to do, it must not be taken to mean that each stage exists independently, the one outside the other.
If! were to imagine a person who had lived without grasping the joy of life or the enjoyment of it and who now at the point of death had his eyes opened to it, if I were to imagine that he did not die, which would be the best that could happen, but revived without therefore living his life over again, this person surely could be considered when the question arises about who is the unhappiest one.
I examine myself; when I am tired of that, I smoke a cigar for diversion and think: God knows what our Lord actually intended with me or what he wants to make of me.
If! pick up a silhouette, I have no impression of it, cannot arrive at an actual conception of it; only when I hold it up toward the wall and do not look at it directly but at what appears on the wall, only then do I see it.
It is a singular feeling when in the midst of enjoyment one looks at it in order to recollect it.
If I found such a one, she would appeal to me from the standpoint of her being a rarity; but from the standpoint of a long period of time she would not appeal to me, for either she would continually remain faithful, and then I would become a sacrifice to my eagerness for experience, since I would have to bear with her, or the time would come when she would lapse, and then I would have the same old story.
Once this feeling is present, it can never turn out that one has made a mistake such as Gert Westphaler made when he drank dus with the executioner.
But if one takes the first aria into consideration, then one presumably will approve the predicates I have used and, if one pays closer attention, will also have the opportunity to see what importance the musical has where it appears as the absolute expression for the idea and how this as a consequence is immediate-musical.
How ridiculous, and what an indirect assault upon marriage! Either marriage has intrinsic reality, and then he is adequately punished by losing it, or it has no reality, and then it is unreasonable to vilify him because he is wiser than others.
When sentimental people, who as such are very boring, become peevish, they are often amusing.
How sterile my soul and my mind are, and yet constantly tormented by empty voluptuous and excruciating labor pains! Will the tongue ligament of my spirit never be loosened; will I always jabber?
The more consistently a person knows how to sustain his arbitrariness, the more amusing the combinations become.
For the sake of order, it is probably best to tell first how I happened to come into possession of these papers.
The difficulties that always arise when music is made the object of esthetic consideration will of course not be absent here either.
He did not love me anymore; that is why he left me, but that, after all, was no deception.
Sensuous immediacy has its absolute medium in music, and this also explains why music in the ancient world did not become properly developed but is linked to the Christian world.
When they are alone their thoughts disappear in the indefinite; on the other hand, when there is noise and hubbub around them, this compels them to pit their will against it.
Just as ghosts in the underworld, when a living being fell into their hands, sucked his blood and lived as long as this blood warmed and nourished them, so Faust seeks an immediate life whereby he will be rejuvenated and strengthened.

Yet one does not want to be so isolated, so unnatural, that one does not regard the family as a whole of which it can be said that when one member suffers, then they all suffer.
When the favorable opportunity is offered, then what is hidden discloses itself.
This is everywhere the case when the objective sorrow in itself is not finished, when it leaves a doubt, whatever its nature is.
When sensuousness manifests itself as that which must be excluded, as that with which the spirit does not wish to be involved, but when spirit has not as yet convicted it or condemned it, sensuousness takes this form, is the demonic in esthetic indifference.
This is why he cannot be given lines, but the music remains the only adequate expression, and thus it is noteworthy that Figaro and Don Giovanni, in their original form from the hand of Mozart, belong to opera seria [serious opera].
It can elude our attention for a long time, but when by chance a look, a word, a sigh, a tone in the voice, a hint in the eyes, a trembling of the lips, or a blunder in the handshake treacherously betrays what has been carefully concealed-then passion is aroused, then the struggle begins.
Such a marriage of convenience may assume a prettier form when the motive is somewhat higher.
If a person possessed a letter that he knew or believed contained information about what he had to consider his life's happiness, but the characters were thin and faint and the handwriting almost illegible, then, presumably with anxiety and agitation, he would read it most passionately again and again and at one moment derive one meaning, at the next moment another, according to how he would explain everything by a word he believed that he had deciphered with certainty, but he would never progress beyond the same uncertainty with which he had begun.
We have seen how this immediate and beautiful but also very naive love, being embodied in the consciousness of a reflective age, must become the object of its mockery and of its irony; and we have seen too what such an age was capable of substituting for it.
A few days ago, I heard a soldier speaking with another soldier about a third one who had deceived a girl; he did not describe it in detail, and yet his expression was excellent: "He knew how to do it with lies and all that." Such a seducer is of a kind entirely different from Don Giovanni, differs from him essentially, which can also be seen in this, that he and his activities are extremely unmusical and
 
esthetically fall within the category of the interesting.
When my physician prescribes a diet for me, there is some reason in that; I abstain from certain specified foods for a certain specified time.
When a possibility is shattered, the momentary pain may not be as great, but frequently it also leaves a little ligament or two whole and undamaged, which remains a constant occasion for continued pain.
When a spider flings itself from a fixed point down into its consequences, it continually sees before it an empty space in which it can find no foothold, however much it stretches.
Everything must be thought of as focused on this one main point of interest that makes up the content of Antigone's life, and when the whole thing is designed in this way, then the question is: How is the dramatic interest to be produced?
On the other hand, you think that when duty makes its appearance it is all over with love, and you think also that duty, early or late, must make its appearance, not merely in conjugal love but also in romantic love; and the truth is that you are afraid of conjugal love because it has in it duty to such a degree that when it makes its appearance you cannot run away from it.
How unfortunate! My doubting soul perhaps would have been captivated by it, by the language as well as by the content.
But am I not indebted to him at all when I hate him?
If I had in my service a submissive jinni who, when I asked for a glass of water, would bring me the world's most expensive wines, deliciously blended, in a goblet, I would dismiss him until he learned that the enjoyment consists not in what I enjoy but in getting my own way.
It is a comfort to me that Diana, who had not given birth herself, came to the aid of women in labor-indeed, that she had this ability from infancy as an inborn gift, so that when she was born she herself helped Latona in her labor pains.
Here I wish only to draw attention to the remarkable circumstance that by a movement in the opposite direction I once again encounter music, namely, when I descend from prose permeated by the concept until I end up with interjections, which in turn are musical, just as a child's first babbling is musical.
When he is on the verge of despair, I will give it all back to him again, but he will have me to thank for it-and then I shall be avenged.

Generally you think of what you call "the visible sacred symbol of the erotic," which, as you say, "like all signs or tokens, has in itself no importance but depends for its significance upon the energy, the artistic bravura and virtuosity, themselves proofs of inborn genius, with which it is executed." "How disgusting it is," you say, "to see the languor with which such things are performed in married life, how perfunctorily, how sluggishly it is done, almost at the stroke of the clock-pretty much as among the tribe the Jesuits discovered in Paraguay, which was so sluggish that the Jesuits found it necessary to ring a bell at midnight as a welcome notice to all husbands, to remind them thereby of their marital duties.
How empty and meaningless life is.
It is still fresh in our memory that a French statesman, when offered a portfolio the second time, declared that he would accept it but on the condition that the secretary of state be made responsible.
The comic lies precisely in the isolation; when one wants to affirm the tragic within this isolation, one has evil in its badness, not the authentic tragic guilt in its ambiguous guiltlessness.
You are within yourself only when there is opposition, but therefore you are never within yourself.
You also will perceive the correctness of this when you reflect that if one were to marry merely in the hope of a silver wedding, and then hoped and hoped again for twenty-five years, one would be in no state to celebrate the silver wedding when the twenty-fifth year came around, for indeed one would have nothing to recollect, since with all this hoping everything would have fallen apart.
What one has loved with youthful infatuation, what one has admired with youthful enthusiasm, that with which one has kept secret, enigmatic company in the inwardness of the soul, that which one has hidden in the heartone always approaches this with a certain shyness, with mixed feelings, when one knows that the purpose is to understand it.
But it is decided, unshakably decided, and she does not need to fear-as is usual with one who is immured alive--that when the scanty ration of bread and water provided her is used up she will perish, for she has nourishment for a long time.
When the sea heaves and is rough, the seething waves in their turbulence form pictures resembling creatures; it seems as if it were these creatures that set the waves in motion, and yet it is, conversely, the swelling waves that form them.
sensual seeks instant satisfaction, and the more refined it is, the better it knows how to make the instant of enjoyment a little eternity.' The true eternity in love, as in true morality, delivers it, therefore, first of all from the sensual.
I feel as a chessman must feel when the opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.
"He was no deceiver, because in order to be that, he would have had to be conscious of it himself from the beginning, but that he was not; my heart tells me that he loved me." If the concept of a deceiver is advanced in this way, then perhaps, when all is said and done, a deceiver has never lived.
Anyone who has ever made the laughter of others and his own the object of observation, who has had in mind, as in this project, not so much the accidental as the universal, who has perceived with psychological interest how different the occasion oflaughter is at every age--that person will readily be convinced that the unchangeable requirement for comedy, that it must arouse laughter, in itself implies a high degree of changeableness in relation to the ideas of the laughable in the varying world consciousness, yet without this difference being so diffuse that the corresponding expression in the somatic functions would be that laughter would manifest itself in weeping.
When desire has not awakened, that which is desired fascinates and captivates-indeed, almost causes anxiety.
And what, after all, is human life, the human race, when these two things are taken away?
Let us take an idea, an expression, from your poetic world, or from the real world of first love: "the lovers look at one another." You know very well how to underscore this word "look" and to put into it an infinite reality, an eternity.
An element of guilt always remains, but this element is not actually reflected subjectively; this is why the sorrow in Greek tragedy is so profound.
When an actuality is shattered, the break is usually far more radical; every nerve is cut, and the break as a break has an implicit completeness.
That anxiety is a reflection category is shown by language itself, for I always say that I am anxious about something, and I thereby distinguish between the anxiety and that about which I am anxious, and I can never use "anxiety" objectively; whereas when I say "my sorrow," I can be expressing as much about what I am grieving over as about my sorrow over it.
Indeed, if there were a human being who could not die, if what the legend tells of the Wandering Jew is true, why should we have scruples about pronouncing him the unhappiest one?
When one reflects on Greek love, it is according to its concept essentially faithful simply because it is psychical; and it is something accidental in the particular individual that he loves many; and with regard to the many he loves, it is again accidental every time he loves a new one; when he loves one, he is not thinking of the next one.
This is why all the finite differences vanish for him in comparison with the main point: to be a woman.
I watched how the pearls of perspiration collected on his forehead, then united in a rivulet, slid down his nose, and ended in a quivering globule that remained suspended at the end of his nose.
But if, as has been observed above, the overture can be regarded as a running start to the opera, if in the overture one descends from that higher atmosphere, then the question is: at what point is it best for one to land in the opera, or how is the begining of the opera achieved?
For that purpose, we arise in the middle of the night like robbers; this is why we risk everything, for no passion is as wild as the passion of sympathy.
Even when the erotic is not entirely neutralized, it is nevertheless disheartened by a -cool common-sense consideration that one must be prudent, not be too quick in sorting and rejecting, that life after all never presents the ideal, that it is quite a respectable match, etc.
Just as someone who has been standing or sitting for a long time in a forced position pleasurably stretches his body, just as a branch that has long been bent by force and then, when the bond is broken, joyfully takes its natural position again, so also does she find refreshment.
But how long is seven times ten years?
Ordinarily when we use the word "plurality," we mean a unity that is the final result; in music such is not the case.
Generally, people think they are saying something very sagacious when they emphasize that Faust ends up by becoming a Don Juan, and yet it does not say very much, for the point is, in what sense does he become that.
When she chose the convent, her proud soul perhaps found rich satisfaction in it, because, say what you will, no girl makes as brilliant a match as she who espouses heaven; but now, on the other hand, now she will have to return penitently, in repentance and contrition.

The more profound natures, who were moved by the idea, found everything, even the softest breeze, expressed in Mozart's music; in its grandiose passion, they found a full-toned expression for what stirred in their own inner beings, they perceived how every mood strained toward that music just as the brook hurries on in order to lose itself in the infinitude of the sea.
When music is used, one is on the wrong road altogether and makes the patient even more insane, even ifhe seems not to be so anymore.
Therefore, when so many admire Greek tragedy, it no doubt is often just parroting, for it is obvious that our age at least has no great sympathy for what is the truly Greek sorrow.
And yet she does not dare to abandon herself to sorrow, does not dare to
 
 
mourn; she feels how much depends upon her; she fears that a clue would be given if anyone saw her suffering, and so here, too, she finds not sorrow but pain.

And how beautiful it is that the God who is spirit loves also the love which is earthly.
Therefore, when Antigone, in defiance of the king's injunction, decides to bury her brother, we see in this not so much a free act as a fateful necessity, which visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children.
So when I say that my maxim is not a point of departure for me, this does not have the opposite of being a point of departure but is merely the negative expression of my maxim, that by which it comprehends itself in contrast to being a point of departure or not being a point of departure.
Robert Ie diable asks how it could happen that he does so much evil.
Should I then communicate my sorrow to the world, make one more contribution to prove how pitiable and wretched everything is, perhaps discover a new, hitherto undetected stain [Plet] in human life?
What I want to do, however, is in part to illuminate the idea from as many sides as possible and its relation to language and thereby continually to encompass more and more the territory where music is at home, to provoke it, so to speak, to declare itself, without my being able to say, when it can be heard, any more than: Listen.
When one reads a name in an epitaph, one is easily tempted to wonder how he passed his life on earth; one might wish to climb down into the grave for a conversation with him.
For is it not ingenious and significant that the floor of this little room is strewn, as is the local custom, with foliage, as if for a funeral; and is not nature itself giving us its approval when we take note of the wild storm raging around us, when we pay heed to the wind's powerful voice?
What a flock of young girls will run straight into a man's arms when they hear the seductive name: a seducer! Give me half a year, and I will produce a story that will be ever so much more interesting than everything I have so far experienced.

When an individual has perfected himself in the art of forgetting and the art of recollecting in this way, he is then able to play shuttlecock with all existence .
When I see myself cursed, abhorred, hated for my coldness and heartlessness, thcn I laugh, then my rage is satisfied.
It is, therefore, surely a misunderstanding of the tragic when our age endeavors to have everything fateful transubstantiate itself into individuality and subjectivity.

If an individual is many, he has lost his freedom and cannot order his riding boots when he wishes, cannot knock about according to whim.
And just as the Greek Antigone cannot bear to have her brother's body thrown away without the last honors, so she feels how harsh it would have been if no one had come to know this; it troubles her that not a tear would have been shed, and she almost thanks the gods because she has been selected as this instrument.
Heiberg was indirectly influenced by Mozart's interpretation to see-namely, how Don Juan must be interpreted as soon as music is not made its proper expression or he is placed in completely different esthetic categories.

When the gods wandered upon the earth and fell in love with women, did they remain faithful to their beloveds?

That words, when they are misused, can confuse the mindjust as much as music, all revivalist sects will surely admit.

On the other hand, why are the government and the governors so afraid of assuming responsibility, unless it is because they fear an opposition party that in turn continually pushes away responsibility on a similar scale.
What to him is of supreme importance is to convince her of how deeply he loves her, indeed, that his life is over ifhe must give up her love.
It does not occur to Antigone to wish anyone to come to know her pain, but instead she feels the pain in relation to her father, feels the justice implicit in sorrowing, which is just as warranted esthetically as is suffering punishment when one has done wrong.
Why was she so beautiful-I could murder her-why am  not just as beautiful?
It would not have been enough if he had encouraged them by saying, "It can be done, love can be preserved"; but when he says, "It shall be preserved," there is in that an authority which answers to the heartfelt desire of love.
As long as she is in the vicinity of Don Giovanni, she is beside herself; when she comes to herself, it is appropriate to think about the paradox.
But it is not said thereby that it is the kingdom of sin, for it must be contained in the moment when it appears in esthetic indifference.
I had arrived before she did, had already been waiting some time when I stepped to the window to see whether she was coming, and a moment later her carriage stopped at the door.
How many he has seduced is of no importance here; what occupies us is the artistry, the meticulousness, the profound cunning with which he seduces.
Don Giovanni is interested in her before the opera begins; the spectator bestows on her his dramatic interest; but we friends of grief, we accompany her not only to the nearest cross street, not only in the moment when she walks across the stage-no, we accompany her on her solitary way.
That which, generally speaking, should be the content of this little exploration will not be so much the relation between the tragic in ancient and in modern drama as it will be an attempt to show how the characteristic feature of the tragic in ancient drama is incorporated in the tragic in modern drama in such a way that what is truly tragic will become apparent.
For example, we say: I cannot really explain why I do this or that in such a way-I play it by ear.
Thus when Kruse has Don Giovanni, as he comes onstage at Zerlina's wedding, say, "Cheer up, children! You are indeed all dressed as for a wedding," he is saying something entirely appropriate and also something more than he perhaps thinks.
This notion is just as boring as the tower was high and is a terrible demonstration of how boredom had gained the upper hand.
When was it that the hetairias became common in Greece except at the time when the state was in the process of disintegration?
But only let our age go on consuming-and the more it manages to consume of the substantial value contained in romantic love with all the more consternation will it some day, when this annihilation no longer gives pleasure, awaken to the consciousness of what it has lost and despairingly feel its misfortune.
It shows how thoroughly reflective this age is, that it must help itself out with such a compromise as a marriage of convenience.
Looking back for a moment over what has been developed here, the reader will perhaps perceive how here again the relation of the idea of Don Juan to the musical has been developed from many sides, how this relation is constitutive of the whole opera, how this is repeated in its several parts.
In the same way, in entirely the same way, Zerlina is dangerous to him when she has been seduced.
When Cherubino, light as a bird, boldly leaps through the window, it affects Susanna so powerfully that she nearly faints, and when she has recovered she cries out, "See how he runs-oh, won't he be a success with the girlS!" This is entirely appropriate for Susanna to say, and the reason for her fainting is not simply the performance of the bold leap but rather that he has already been a success with her.
She need not fear that they will surround her too closely-indeed, they know very well how to open ranks in order to expedite her departure.
Then it is a matter ofhaving vigilance and perseverance and sagacity, for who is as inventive as secret sorrow, but a solitary lifetime prisoner has adequate time to think up many things, and who is as swift to find concealment as secret sorrow, for no young girl can cover in greater anxiety and haste a bosom she has exposed than hidden sorrow when it is surprised.
My heart has never been hardened toward anyone, but I have always made it appear, especially when I was touched most deeply, as if my heart were closed and alien to every feeling.
For example, when a brook ripples and keeps on rippling, there seems to be a qualification of time involved therein.
A dialectical qualification that must be strictly maintained is this:
 
only when there is an object is there desire; only when there is desire is there an object.
The immediate Don Juan must seduce,; the reflective Don Juan needs to seduce only one, and how he does it is what occupies us.
When a person standing on a high point gazes out over a flat region and sees several roads running parallel to one another, he will, ifhe lacks intuition, see only the roads, and the fields between them will seem to disappear, or he will see only the fields, and the roads will disappear; however, he who has an intuitive eye will see them together, will see the whole section as striped.
How dreadful boredom is-how dreadfully boring; I know no stronger expression, no truer one, for like is recognized only by like.
That Byron was in many ways particularly endowed to present a Don Juan is certain enough, and therefore one can be sure that when that undertaking failed, the reason was not in Byron but in something far deeper.
Just as when a girl resolves to sacrifice her life for an idea, when she stands there with the sacrificial wreath on her forehead, she stands as a bride, for the great animating idea transforms her, and the sacrificial wreath is like the bridal wreath.
There have been times when I would have given everything for a ticket; now I do not even need to pay one rix-dollar for a ticket.
We shall now proceed and see how the unhappy individuality may be defined more precisely.
Perhaps I could easily have deleted an occasional negligence, which is quite understandable when one considers that he is merely a letter writer.
The destroyed possibility appears transfigured in a higher possibility, whereas the temptation to conjure up a new possibility such as this is not as great when it is an actuality that has been shattered, because the actuality is higher than the possibility.
I feel an anxiety, an unspeakable anxiety, an anxiety such as I felt in the convent when I sat in my solitary cell and waited for him and my thoughts terrified me: the prioress's intense scorn, the convent's terrible punishment, my offense against God.
Perhaps the time is coming when Europe will import the customs of foreign lands.
To develop in greater detail the transition in this aria, how in the beginning it is quiet and less stirring but becomes more and more intense as Don Giovanni's life resonates in it more and more, how Leporello is more and more swept away by it, wafted away and rocked by these erotic breezes, how it is variously nuanced accordingly as the diversity of femininity that lies within Don Giovanni's range becomes audible in it-this is not the place for that.
Ordinarily, he enjoys the honor of being regarded as being in his right mind, and yet he knows that if he were to explain to a single person how it really is with him, he would be declared insane.
Yes, lovable Margarete! Goethe betrayed how you plucked the petals and recited the words: He loves me, he loves me not.
In the tragic there is implicit a sadness and a healing that one indeed must not disdain, and when someone wishes to gain himself in the superhuman way our age tries to do it, he loses himself  and becomes comic.
There would also be no lack of opportunity to illuminate the erotic from a new side by observing how the attempt to put a more profound ethical view into it, in such a way that it tries its hand at all sorts of rather important dialectical engagements, is a daring venture that has ventured far beyond the boundaries of music, so that it was impossible even for a Mozart to invest it with any deeper interest.
The idea of the seducer is suggested in the piece on the immediate erotic as well as in "Silhouettes"-namely, that the counterpart to Don Giovanni must be a reflective seducer in the category of the interesting, where the issue therefore is not how many he seduces but how.
But one is absent when one is in either past or future time.
Therefore, one is inclined to shut the eyes when listening to music.
And where can this better be found than in a young girl, and how can he more completely imbibe this than in the embrace of erotic love?
It must be as a warning, and all the more so since everyone must be gripped by a certain sadness because no matter how much the world has changed, the idea of the tragic is still essentially unchanged, just as weeping still continues to be equally natural to humankind.
Thus, when the book is read, A and B are forgotten; only the points of view confront each other and expect no final decision in the particular personalities.
So it is when the subject matter is made the principle of division.
Once again I was absorbed in contemplation of the lust oflife and the serene peace of the cloister, when high up on the mountain I saw a female figure.
Of course, she is! But how is this grief to be characterized?
As a ship is saluted with a cannonade when it is launched, so I would salute myself.
Thus, when Philoctetes laments that he lives abandoned and solitary on a desolate island, his remark also has external truth; when, however, our Antigone feels pain in her solitude, it is only figuratively that she is alone, but for this very reason, only then is her pain truly literal.
Why, then, do I complain because a man is not like a woman, not as happy as she is when she is happy, not as unhappy as she is when she is boundlessly unhappy because her happiness knew no bounds.
In grammar school, when I was fifteen years old, I wrote very suavely on demonstrations for the existence of God and the immortality of the soul, on the concept of faith, and on the meaning of miracles.
Isolation always consists in asserting oneself as number; when one wants to assert oneself as one, this is isolation; all the friends of associations will surely agree with me on that, without therefore being able or willing to see that it is altogether the same isolation when a hundred assert themselves simply and solely as a hundred.
In another place, B mentions a Greek wise man by the name of Myson and relates that he enjoyed the rare good fortune of being counted among the seven sages, when their number is set at fourteen.
And if she perhaps cannot force back the tears, then she is sure to be misunderstood; then perhaps she cries herself out, for when one lives in an ecclesia pressa [persecuted church], it is truly a joy that one's divine service harmonizes in its mode of expression with the public mode.
It was not because he was an extraordinary person that she loved him, far from it; she was very aware of his faults, but she believed he was a good man, a faithful man, and that was why she loved him.
Their beauty passes away like a dream and like yesterday when it is past.
Not until spirit is posited is language installed in its rights, but when spirit is posited, everything that
 
The Immediate Erotic Stages
 
is not spirit is excluded.
But when sensuality is viewed under the qualification of spirit, its significance is seen to be that it is to be excluded, but precisely because it is to be excluded it is defined as a principle, as a power, for that which spirit, which is itself a principle, is supposed to exclude must be something that manifests itself as a principle, even though it does not manifest itself as a principle until the moment when it is excluded.
Already in the ethical and religious factors it has duty in it, and when this appears before it, it is not as a Stranger, a shameless intruder, who nevertheless has such authority that one dare not by virtue of the mysteriousness of love show him the door.
Indeed, how many are there in our day who truly dare to wish, dare to desire, dare to address nature neither with a polite child's bitte, bitte [please, please] nor with the raging frenzy of one damned?
And when I have brought her to the point where I want her, then she is mine." But perhaps I have already misused my position as editor to burden the readers with my observations.
I am no husband who needs an unusual girl to make me happy; every girl has what makes me happy, and therefore I take them all." That is how the words I touched on earlier must be understood: even coquettes as old as sixty-or in another place: pur che porti la gonel/a, voi sapete que! che fo [if she just wears a skirt, you know well enough what he does].
Juan, then his expression is such a travesty that it is impossible to keep from laughing-for example, when Sganarelle tells Gusman that Don Juan, in order to obtain the one he wants, "would gladly marry her dog or cat-yes, even worse, marry you, too.
A tragic turn cannot very well be produced when the idea is perceived to be wholly unjustified, and therefore the comic is so close at hand.
How many are there who-inspired by what is talked about so much in our age, that man is created in God's image-have the authentic voice of command?
It is not at all my intention to deny what in fact has been acknowledged many times, that music may have its importance as an accompaniment when entering a foreign domain, namely, the domain of language.
Previously, when it merely beckoned, I mounted, light, hearty, and cheerful.
Human dignity is still acknowledged even in nature, for when we want to keep birds away from the trees we set up something that is supposed to resemble a human being, and even the remote resemblance a scarecrow has to a human being is sufficient to inspire respect.
Many believe they, too, are this when after doing one thing or another they unite or mediate these opposites.
He needs no preparation, no plan, no time, for he is always ready; that is, the power is always in him, and the desire also, and only when he desires is he properly in his element.
Just when this moment arrives is difficult to determine, but it proclaims itself in a mysterious way; one feels it and can no longer say De to the other.
If it is strictly understood, the result will be to argue the very opposite of what was really intended, as is always the case when one moves abstractly in dialectical qualifications, where it is the case that one not only says one thing and means something else but says something else; what one thinks one is saying one does not say but says the opposite.
It by no means follows that one must regard it as the devil's work, even though one detects with a certain secret horror that this art, more than any other art, frequently torments its devotees in a terrible way, a phenomenon, strangely enough, that seems to have escaped the attention of the psychologists and the mass, except on a particular occasion when they are alarmed by a desperate individual's scream of anxiety.
With her depth of soul, when she ever falls in love, she is bound to love with an extraordinary passion.
When I think about it now, it seems to me that such an appointment was just the thing for me.
For, of course, if duty has not already subsisted as a germ in first love, it is absolutely disturbing when it makes its appearance.
It has already been pointed out that music as a medium does not rank as high as language, and that is why I said that music, understood in a certain way, is a language.
It actually exists only when it is being performed.
We shout to the whole world, and when it approaches us in a friendly manner we say, "It was not this Maren." My life is like an eternal night; when I die, I shall be able to say with Achilles:

Du bist vollbracht, Nachtwache meines Daseyns [You are fulfilled, nightwatch of my life].
For example, in the second act, at the crucial moment when Ottavio finally has gathered courage in his heart and taken the rapier out of its sheath to murder Don Giovanni, she hurls herself between them and then discovers that it is not Don Giovanni but Leporello--a differentiation that Mozart has so powerfully expressed with a kind of plaintive bleat.
Moreover, it has often occurred to me to wonder why, according, to the universal usage and way of thinking, the state of single blessedness has no such brilliant prospects, that on the contrary, people rather turn it to ridicule when a bachelor celebrates a jubilee.
Yea, so long as every nerve in you is aquiver, whether when you are stealing softly about, or when you step out boldly and Janizary music within you drowns out your consciousness-then you feel that you are living.
Although it can thus be truly said that Don Giovanni is a seducer, this term, which can easily confuse the weak brains of some estheticians, frequently gives occasion for misunderstanding when some random comments that could be said about such a person and have been scraped together then are automatically transferred to Don Giovanni.
When two people fall in love with each other and sense that they are destined for each other, it is a question of having the courage to break it off, for by continuing there is only everything to lose, nothing to gain.
Therefore, when we later hear about Don Giovanni: Even coquettes as old as sixty He gladly records in his tally,  we have the perfect analogy to this, except that the intensity and firmness of the desire are far more developed.
Marie Beaumarchais
The girl taken as our subject is known to us in Goethe's Clavigo, except that we shall follow her a little further in time, when she has lost dramatic interest, when the accompaniments of sorrow have gradually abated.
Why not settle it all at once, why not stay out there and go along down into the grave and draw lots to see to whom will befall the misfortune of being the last of the living who throws the last three spadefuls of earth on the last of the dead?
Hear how he plunges down into the multiplicity of life, how he breaks against its solid embankment.
Why was I not born in Nyboder,  why did I not die as a baby?
If, then, my thesis is true, a person needs only to ponder how corrupting boredom is for people, tempering his reflections more or less according to his desire to diminish or increase his impetus, and if he wants to press the speed of the motion to the highest point, almost with danger to the locomotive, he needs only to say to himself: Boredom is the root of all evil.
In such a case it is a motive foreign to the marriage which decides the matter-as, e.g. when a young girl, out of love for her family, marries a man who is in a position to rescue it.
And A's reaction does not surprise me, for I, too, who have nothing at all to do with this narrative-indeed, am twice removed from the original author-I, too, sometimes have felt quite strangely uneasy when I have been occupied with these papers in the stillness of the night.
When she thinks of the cold cunning, the shabby commonsensicality it took to deceive her in such a way that it does not look so bad in the eyes of the world, so that she becomes prey to the sympathy that says, "Well, good Lord, it isn't so terrible," she is shocked, she can almost go insane at the thought of the proud superiority for which she has meant nothing at all, which has set a limit for her and said, "Up to here and no further." And yet the whole thing can also be explained in another, a more beautiful, way.
This no doubt says very much when it is understood properly, but very little when it is interpreted with a certain customary vagueness.
There is also something upon which You will agree with me entirely, for how often and how surely have your mockery and your irony hit the mark when you were denouncing what you call "fortuitous love affairs" and the "bad infinity" of love-when one is looking with his sweetheart out of the window, and that instant a young girl turns the corner into another street, and it occurs to him, "It is with her I am really in love," but when he would follow her trace he is again unsettled, etc.
How he deceived Elvira, by what means he lured her out of the convent, all this we presumably are to learn from a few of Sganarelle' s lines, but since the seduction scene that occurs in the play does not give us an occasion to admire Don Juan's art, confidence in those reports is naturally weakened.
Then I will steal into his soul when he wants to love another-not in order to kill this love; that would be no punishment, for  know that he loves her just as little as he loved me.
When Epaminondas was wounded in the battle at Mantinea, he let the arrow remain in the wound until he heard that the battle was won, for he knew that it was his death when it was pulled out.
In romantic love, on the other hand, you think this is all right, for as soon as the instant arrives when duty is mentioned, love is over, and the arrival of duty is the signal for you, with a very courtly bow, to say farewell.
She feels how much has been placed into her hands, and this gives her the preternatural magnitude that is necessary in order for her to engage us tragically.
Perhaps there is nothing striking about the exterior, but when I look through it, only then do I discover the interior picture, which is what I want to show, an interior picture that is too delicate to be externally perceptible, since it is woven from the soul's faintest moods.
When one throws a pebble in such a way that it skims the surface of the water, it can for a time skip over the water in light hops, but it sinks down to the bottom
 
 
as soon as it stops skipping; in the same way he dances over the abyss, jubilating during his brief span.
Since it is important with respect to Margarete's grief, we shall now consider more closely how Faust presumably must have affected her.
When Don Juan is interpreted musically, I hear in him the total infinitude of passion, but also its infinite power that nothing can resist; I hear the wild craving of desire, but also the absolute victoriousness of this desire, against which any attempted opposition would be ineffectual.
I should perhaps be a prudent girl and not throw him away in proud contempt now when I know that he is a deceiver; I should perhaps be a good housewife who, with economic sense, knows how to stretch as far as possible the little that she has.
As for Elvira, the factual evidence that Don Giovanni was a deceiver seems so obvious that it is hard to see how reflection can take hold of it.
The Elementary Originality of the Sensuous Qualified as Seduction
When the idea of Don Juan emerged is not known; only this much is certain-that it is linked to Christianity and through Christianity to the Middle Ages.
In my early years, when I went to a restaurant, I would say to the waiter: A good cut, a very good cut, from the loin, and not too fat.
How monotonous, and yet how rich in change! Such is the home life of marriage: quiet, modest, purling-it has not many changements and et like that water it purls, yet like that water it has melody, dear to the man who knows it, dear to him above all other sounds because he knows it.
That which occupies us here is the subtlety, the cunning, whereby he knows how to steal into a girl's heart, the dominion he knows how to gain over it, the enthralling, deliberate, progressive seduction.
But this is by no means so; the vigor, the courage, that wants to be the creator of its own good fortune in this way, indeed, its own creator, is an illusion, and when the age loses the tragic, it gains despair.
When you were with me, they obeyed your suggestions; then I played with them as a child; I braided a wreath of them and put them on my head; I let them flow like my hair, ruffled in the wind.
This no doubt is due to the sure esthetic eye with which Heiberg always comprehends his task, the taste with which he knows how to discriminate, but in the present instance it is still not impossible that Prof.
It is another matter when the objective sorrow or the occasion of the sorrow in the individual himself fosters the reflection that makes the sorrow into a reflective sorrow.
It makes no pompous display, and yet sometimes there is shed over it a luster which does not interrupt its customary course, as when the moonbeams fall upon the water and reveal the instrument upon which it plays its melody.
So if art will not limit itself to the naIvete (examples are found in old books) in which a figure is portrayed that can represent almost anything, but one discovers on its breast a plaque, a heart or something similar, on which one may read everything, especially when the figure's posture draws a person's attention to it, even points to it, an effect that could just as well be achieved by writing above it "Please note!"-if art will not do this, it will be obliged to reject pictures of that kind and leave reflective grief to poetic or psychological treatment.
Then when I walk past people, happy-go-lucky as a god, and they envy me because of my good fortune, I laugh, for I despise people, and I take my rcvenge.
And when he speaks it is nothing new he has to say, and when he has spoken the individuals humble themselves under it., but at the same time are uplifted just because they are assured that what he enjoins is what they themselves wish, and that his commanding it is merely a more majestic, a more exalted, a divine
 
way of expressing the fact that their wish can be realized.
The point here, of course, is not to see a single individual in the Page, something one is so easily tempted to do when in thought or in actuality the Page is represented by a person.
There is a folk book, the title of which is rather familiar even though the book itself is little used, which is especially strange in our age when everybody is so engrossed in the idea of Faust.
My soul is like the Dead Sea, over which no bird is able to fly; when it has come midway, it sinks down, exhausted, to death and destruction.
Only when reflection enters in does the kingdom manifest itself as the kingdom of sin, but then Don Juan has been slain, then the music stops, then one sees only the desperate defiance that powerlessly resists but can find no firm ground, not even in sounds.
Love drives out fear; yet when love is for a moment fearful for itself., fearful of its own salvation, duty is the nutriment of all others love stands in need of; for it says, "Fear not, you shall conquer," speaking not futuristically, for that only suggests hope, but imperatively, and in this lies an assurance which nothing can shake.
He is not suffi"ciently reflective to have an idea of sin and guilt; when he sees an adult suffer, it does not cross his mind to think about that, and yet if the reason for the suffering is hidden from him, there is a dark presentiment of the reason in the child's sorrow.
When I rode slowly through the forest, it seemed as if! were flying.
On the other hand, when an adult sees a young person, a child, suffer, the pain is greater, the sorrow less.
Or is it not, then, a reason to love methat I need you, that my soul languishes when you are not with me?
How much more, then, those who have understood him perfectly, how much more must they feel happy with the fortunate one.
She lost childhood's illusion when she acquired that of erotic love; she lost erotic love's illusion when Clavigo deceived her; if it were possible for her to acquire sorrow's illusion, she would be helped.
Why is it my friend?
But when he is conceived in music, then I do not have the particular individual, then I have a force of nature, the demonic, which no more wearies of se-

ducing or is through with seducing than the wind with blowing a gale, the sea with rocking, or a waterfall with plunging down from the heights.
Taking it all in all, it is remarkable how voracious modern poetry is, and for a long time it has been living on nothing else but love.
When David really wanted to feel his power and glory, he had his people counted; in our age, however, it may be said that the people, in order to feel their significance over against a superior power, count themselves.
When at times she wants to tear herself away from all this, wants to reduce it to nothing, this is again only a mood, a momentary passion, and reflection continually goes on being the victor.
The Mozartian music was in no respect too narrow; on the contrary, their own moods were expanded, took on a preternatural magnitude when they rediscovered them in Mozart.
He does not love people at all; he loves only ideas, thoughts, his powerful influence at court, his intellectual power-I cannot imagine how he can love all these things.
When one imagines these two powers face to face with each other but unable to catch hold of each other because the one is always disappearing and is replaced by the other, the one merely appearing in the role of the other-such a situation would certainly not be without comic power.
Her love gives her significance for him, and yet she becomes practically a child; he condescends to her childlikeness and has his joy in seeing how she appropriates everything.
But how pitiful it is that this should be the only comfort that is left to the poetry of our age, the comfort of despairing; for it is evidently despair which makes such an alliance acceptable.
If the various media are ordered according to a specific process of development, language and music must be placed closest to each other, and that is also why it has been said that music is a language, which is more than a clever observation.
This in turn occurs because it comes into existence in another sense, and that is why I promptly said that boldly ventured is only half won.
I prefer to talk with children, for one may still dare to hope that they may become rational beings; but those who have become that-good Lord!lO How unreasonable people are! They never use the freedoms they have but demand those they do not have; they have freedom of thought-they demand freedom of speech.
When the immediate, qualified by spirit, is qualified in such a way that it falls within the realm of spirit, it can certainly find its expression in the musical, but this immediacy still cannot be music's absolute theme, for when it is qualified in such a way that it will fall within the realm of spirit, this suggests that music is in alien territory; it forms a prelude that is continually being annulled.
Then, when he has read the book, he can perhaps think of the title.
My heart pounded when I went into the shop.
Mozart's music certainly has been tempting, for where is the young man who has not had a moment in his life when he would have given half his kingdom to be a Don Juan, or perhaps all of it, when he would have given half his lifetime for one year of being Don Juan, or perhaps his whole life?
He meets her at Oedipus's grave, where she has gone to pour out her heart, where she abandons herself to her longing for her father, even if this longing is itself mixed with pain because she does not know how she is going to meet him again, whether or not he knew of his guilt.
Indeed, he was not married to me; we had not received the blessing of the Church; the bell had not rung for us; no hymn was sung-and yet what was all the music and celebration of the Church; how would it be able to put me in a mood comparable to this anxiety! -But then he came, and the disharmony of my anxiety dissolved into the most blissful harmony of security, and only faint tremblings voluptuously stirred my soul.
The spoken lines, which are either Schikaneder's or the Danish translator's, are generally so lunatic and foolish that it is almost incomprehensible how Mozart has brought as
 
much out of them as he has done.
This is how she encounters Don Giovanni.
When Don Juan is comprehended in this way, there is meaning and deep significance in everything.
If you cannot reach the point of seeing the aesthetical, the ethical, and the religious as three great allies, if you do not know how to conserve the unity of the diverse appearances which everything assumes in these diverse spheres, then life is devoid of meaning, then one must grant that you are justified in maintaining your pet theory that one can say of everything, "Do it or don't do it-you will regret both." .
Music does not exist except in the moment it is performed, for even if a person can read notes ever so well and has an ever so vivid imagination, he still cannot deny that only in a figurative sense does music exist when it is being read.
For the sake of completeness I shall transcribe the whole of it:
 
How much must come together in the world That love's enchantment may be brought to pass! First the two hearts which know each other well, Then charm which doth accompany them both, The moon then casting its bewitching beams Through the beech forests in the early spring, Then that these two can meet there all alone Then the first kiss-and then .
So if I, trying to do my part to help the reader gain a picture of Don Giovanni, were to say: See, there he stands! See how his eyes flame; he smiles triumphantly, so sure is he of his conquest.
When one looks long and attentively at a face, sometimes another face, as it were, is discovered within the face one sees.
The point is that I do not
 
stop now, but I stopped when I began.
Because of its pride, the egotistically proud love regards a deception as impossible; it is not concerned with finding out what can be said for or against, how the person concerned can be defended or excused; it is absolutely sure, because it is too proud to believe that anyone would dare to deceive it.
From that I concluded that my wish was granted and decided that the gods knew how to express themselves with good taste, for it would indeeq have been inappropriate to reply solemnly: It is granted to yoU.
For this reason, once when there was a great catch of salmon, the police in Hamburg ordered each master of a household to give his servants salmon not more than once a week.
Have mercy again on the world; open up once again to gather in everything and keep us all safe in your womb! I greet you, dark night, I greet you as the victor, and this is my comfort, for in eternal oblivion you shorten everything, day and time and life and the irksomeness of recollection!
Since the time when Lessing defined the boundaries between poetry and art in his celebrated treatise Laokoon, it no doubt may be regarded as a conclusion unanimously recognized by all estheticians that the distinction between them is that art is in the category of space, poetry in the category of time, that art depicts repose, poetry motion.
When once there awakens an apprehension of love's proper dialectic, an apprehension of its pathological struggle, of its relation to the ethical, to the religious, verily one will not have need of hard-hearted fathers or ladies' bowers, or enchanted princesses or ogres and monsters in order to give love plenty to do.
In fact, it is really lucky that you did buy it, for every time you look at it you will be reminded of how prodigal you were; with this desk commences a new period in your life.
And why does it not rage even more violently and put an end to life and the world and this short speech, which at least has the merit exceeding everything else that it is soon ended.
