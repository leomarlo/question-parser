Why, then, did he assure me in the beginning that he loved me so much?
Or did he perhaps make a mistake; was it perhaps an illusion that he loved me, an illusion that disappeared like a dream-is this befitting in a man?
What, do you really think That there are gods?
Have you observed that there is also another sort of neurasthenia?
